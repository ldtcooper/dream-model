    "body": "I (26F) just woke up from a dream where I was visiting one of my sister‚Äôs jobs and she works at a nursing home and was showing me and my other sister and my cousin the ropes. Only, my sisters aren‚Äôt related and we‚Äôve never done anything together in real life. (Moms side then dads side) and my cousin has passed away. My cousin was also walking, but while she was alive she‚Äôd been bound to a wheel chair. In this aspect, I feel that she was visiting me and telling me where she is now she doesn‚Äôt have to use that anymore. ‚ô•Ô∏è after the nursing home my sisters went their separate ways but I wanted to catch up with my cousin so we stayed together. At this point I had lost my house keys and my phone and couldn‚Äôt find them anywhere but my cousin had hers so we headed to her place. Only, when we arrived and she tried using her key to open the door it wouldn‚Äôt work. I said, ‚Äúlet me try, there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs the wrong key‚Äù and the way I shoved it in the door and turned it - it worked for me. We entered her home and it was very nice, but when I went in the kitchen the oven had a fire burning inside of it that we had to put out. I was looking around and started opening the cabinet doors in the kitchen and I distinctly remember two jugs of red diamond sweet tea in the cupboard. One jug was full the other had about 1/4 missing and I thought it was weird as hell to keep tea there and not in the fridge. Now that I think about it I didn‚Äôt open the fridge to check what was there that may have been interesting. It was only while at her house that I noticed she was walking and she said, ‚Äúoh yea this? It‚Äôs no big deal üòåüòú‚Äù other than getting a little visit from my cousin, is there anything that can be interpreted from this dream?"

I was taking left and right turns, eventually I got a little lost. Then suddenly, I hear a church bell. It was low-pitched, and when I heard it, I got shocked and turned back immediately, but there was no church, neither a bell anywhere. then I tried to ignore it but a second church bell went off and was the same as the first one, low-pitched. Then I really got scared and started to think what and where the hell is this bell coming from. Then I started speed-walking in stress and then, a third church bell went off, but it was a slower, and a lower-pitched sound and I realised, I couldn‚Äôt move. I tried to mve my body but I was paralysed as if I were completely frozen. I couldn‚Äôt even more my fingers or anything just like in sleep paralysis. I could only move my eyes. I looked around and on a tree, I saw it covered in black cobweb, but not a single spider on that tree. and this strong wind blew out of nowhere and made a tree fall right infront of me, and the exact moment the tree fell, I wasn‚Äôt frozen anymore. I could move again and then, as fast as I could, I RAN. I ran and ran and ran. But that‚Äôs not the creepy part. The creepy part was that the further I ran, I ended up back at the fallen tree. The same tree that fell and where I unfroze. I got even more scared and creeped out completely. I ran and ran and ran, but ended up back where I started running, back right at that fallen tree. Then I ran and ran again, still ended up in the same place. I was out of breath completely, and I tried to breathe, but I couldn‚Äôt and collapsed in front of the fallen free, and the position I was collapsed in, was the position I woke up from the ‚Äúdream‚Äù"

    "body": "Hello!\n\nI‚Äôve had a dream on two separate occasions where people I was interested in were my stepfather.\n\nIn the first dream, we were on a family trip white water rafting (my family is not active) and they were trying really hard to be a good step father and telling me to make the most of this. That even though it didn‚Äôt work out with me, I should be a good sport for him and my mom. This was after he had broken up with me in reality so I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I had a similar dream with a different crush. This dream was bright with a lot of yellows and greens and sunny days \n\nAround the time of the second dream, I just started dating a very sweet guy. After our first date, that went really well, I had a dream that an OLD crush, from around 10 years ago, was my stepfather. I haven‚Äôt spoken to that crush in years, though I think about them from time to time. It was weird because he knew he was my step father but he wasn‚Äôt married to my mom, so it was confusing how he was my step father. He kept checking me out or making weird comments about my body but also fully aware he was my step father. We were kinda arguing a lot but toward the end he genuinely tried to make amends with me. In reality they have become a kind of successful actor (not A list or anything but they‚Äôre in some shows. I don‚Äôt watch their work) So maybe that played a part in the dream? Oh! Also in the dream I had a huge rock giant that was my friend and kinda my bulldog that would kinda intimidate my ‚Äústep father‚Äù, especially when he tried to make amends. The colors here were a more dark Hunter green with some browns around dusk time with almost a grainy feel\n\nI‚Äôm open to any interpretation anyone might have. Thank you in advance!"

    "body": "So last night I had a dream that I died.I don't think it was mentioned how i did in my dream but i was dead.And i was a ghost and in the dream i was at a school,it looked like a better school than the one i was at it was kind of prestigious in the sense that it had like columns and a giant staircase up to the top of the school.But anyways my sister and my friends and everyone that i go to school with was [there.](https://there.So) So as a ghost i was able to interact with physical things like people paper and pencils etc.And i hung around my sister and my best friend.And i remember as a ghost I hugged the both of them extremely tight and I was crying because they couldn't see me.And when i was hanging around the two i saw a paper and pencil and I wrote \"This is your sister I died,I'm sorry\". And I hugged them both [again.](https://again.So) So in the dream i hugged everyone,all my friends and the people that have been nice to me during the school year. And I saw the boy that I like.(For context I had confessed to this boy and things are kind of confusing between us.And we had just experienced some awkwardness during the day I had this dream on) So in the dream i was really happy to see him.But i remembered that I was still a ghost.But I didn't care, I hugged and kissed him so many times.And i don't know it was weird because i could subconsciously feel how tight I was hugging him like i was hugging him that tightly in real life.And as I kissed his face many times as a ghost I saw him  get really happy and flustered and he goes to tell his best friend that something strange had happened and he was so happy.And as a ghost I felt how fast his heart was [beating.](https://beating.SO) So after this happened I find my friend and sister and I grab some paper and a pen and I tell them my plan to tell him that i had died but that I still love him. So as a ghost i write a letter telling him all my feelings and how my I love him and how I missed him.And when my sister and friend give the letter to him he cries. And then I become aware that I was dreaming because I had a feeling that he wouldn't care,that he would dismiss my friends,and that he wouldn't cry but he cried. And I was so happy in my dream that he was crying because that meant he remembers me.And he was crying in front of our friends,and they were confused but they read the letter and became sad and comforted him as he cried. And I woke up feeling that this was one of the happiest dreams I've had,but I feel sad because of how unrealistic it was.Or because how i feel it was too unrealistic.BUt that just makes me even sadder."

So I wasn‚Äôt sure what to do with it and in the process of thinking about calling 911, the lid came off by accident, and so panicked I threw it out my window (I live on the 10th floor of a building with a parking lot &amp; patch of grass below the window) and it blew up and caused some damage. police was everywhere I was hiding and hoping nobody would figure out that I threw it and misunderstand the situation thinking I‚Äôm a terrorist rather than someone who was almost terrorized. Lots of weird paranoid feelings in between but the dream ended with me telling my mom I feel like if I explain the situation they‚Äôll understand that it was just my instinct to throw it our my window and get it far away from me and won‚Äôt imprison me. \n\nAnybody have an interpretation for this?

It was an apartment, but I knew it was my brain (like the SpongeBob scene with the filing cabinets) I really wanted to go in and look but it was very dim inside and something told me that there was something dark awaiting around the corner in there.

    "body": "!!Long post, need help!! \n!!TW, mention of Suicide!! \n\nA little bit of context: A few years back, I came out as an Atheist to my parents and at first they didn't take it well. I think they saw they couldn't do much since I was 19 at the time. I'm turning 21 next month the 13th. Beginning February 2023 is when I started to praise/whorship/ work with Greek Deities and I haven't told them or hinted that I am. \n\nDream:\nOkay, so it started off with me at home on my bed when my mom came  in, gave me some brochures of an extremely intense looking church. Fsr, I dreamt that I went to school (like as a student) saw my best friend there and told her what my mom gave me what she expected from me. I did mention something about Revelation 3. In the dream she just turned to face the front of the assembly hall, without saying a word about it further.\n\nSchool came out, but I was like really late to be home. On the way home, I picked up a shell in the middle of the road in front of Danie Malan Primary School. \n\nThen it was suddenly pitch black dark and it was raining. I walked back like home to where I live irl, but I somehow ended up at another flat, that looked 10x better. I arrive. I called out for another friend (call her Ellie) while her boyfriend's dog chased someone down the road. He ran out after him and Ellie let me enter.\n\nNext thing I knew, after I laid down on a bed, I was back home in my mom's living room but this living room was from a house that was almost in the mountain. (a house we lived in long ago) \n\nIt had the living room but more spacious. I sat on the red single seated chair that was in front of my stepdad's aquarium that he had at the time. I saw my mom at the dinner table with boxes surrounding her. It felt like \"we're moving\" vibes she had a book with her that belonged to ME. She ripped out the first page where I had song lyrics written in and wrote a bible verse on the new page and gave me a plastic bag with stuff inside, sending me to my room.\n\nI walked into the room I currently have. With everything like it is now. My computer was on the table next to me, closet in front of my bed everything.\n\nBefore I could read the verse or open the bag, I went to our patio. My mom had the laptop open watching Charlie and the Chocolate factory (idk why) then said something like \"when I was younger, I was tricked into watching movies I didn't understand. Much like this one.\" She turned to me like a stoned zombie.\" I won't let the stuff you like do the same to you. You will go to this Christian church.\"\n\nI ran out, crying as I went to my room. I opened the bag she gave me and saw other brochures that offered the same services. I started crying more, my stepdad hears the crying. Entering the room, he stood in front my bed, opened the closet and was like.\" Now, were changing this room so thay we can keep an eye on you! Your bed is going to go to the front of the door that'll stay open. All the things you like are going to be thrown into the closet (the one he opened) they started with my Kane Chronicle books. I tried keeping them away from them. When I looked down in my lap I saw some weird package in my lap that was definitely a Rick Riordan product. I opened the box and saw more Kane Chronicles stuff in there. (mostly books). My stepdad tried taking that too. With the book he tried to take before. He snatched it out of my hand. Then my mother walked in and they both just started laughing.\n\nIt's then when I woke up, I wasn't wide awake. I had like images go through my head of me grabbing a knife and then going into the bathroom.\n\nThen I was wide awake.\nReading the last bit, I think I had the idea to stab myself in the stomach to bleed out and I did have suicidal thoughts before. \n\nThis dream terrified me and I don't know what to do with it. I tried looking for answers online but only found sweet nothings. \n\nI'd really appreciate it if someone can give me something to work with. I'll answer any questions related to the dream in the comments. Thank you."

    "body": "I've been writing down my dreams in an app called Dream Catcher. The dream I had last night seems connected to one I had last July.\n\nNow this is probably going to be a lot to read but quite a few of these details are replicated in the more recent dream so I feel that they're worth mentioning.\n\nThe dream that I had last July started with me playing a video game on the Wii U (which makes sense as that was my main game system back in middle school)\nThen eventually it shifted so that I was in the backseat of my parents car playing the same game (the Wii U is not portable but I digress)\n\nI looked up at the windshield and saw a beautiful girl walking by who was remarkably slender in appearance.\n\nMy dad was holding up a DS like a phone and said that I have to reach level 36 to be able to talk with this person.\n\nThen I was sitting outside at a bus stop and that girl asked me if I'd heard of this band which both was and wasn't the Beatles (you know how dreams tend to be)\n\nSo we talked about that band for a while and at some point I ended up in a room that looks like the basement that I had fallen asleep in in real life.\naround this time I was staying at my aunt and uncle's house and sleeping in their basement on a couch that had a big window behind it.\n\nThe girl was sitting beside me on the couch instead of the bus stop, she was showing me this phone game via a screen on the wall that looked like a projector screen but with nothing projecting it.\nShe said that you can unlock songs by that band by playing through this game.\n\nThe game was one of those ones where you raise a little pet animal, in this case it was a cutesy raccoon.\n\nShe told me I needed to unlock something for her. (Something in my head was telling me that I needed to unlock her in this game so she could stay with me)\n\nShe looked like an average girl my age and was very beautiful and cute\n\nAt some point I went to open the blinds above the couch and the girl started to panic and asked \"why are you doing that?\" \n\nI said \"just to make sure you're not imaginary\", she looked sad, disappointed, like what I just said confirmed that none of this was going to work out in their favor.\n\nI opened the blinds and there was nothing but bright white light, which didn't look abnormal or anything, I feel like I've kind of seen that before in real life. She said \"what if I am imaginary?\"\n\nI said \"are you?\" she kind of ashamedly nodded yes,\n\nI said \"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to\" \"I can still play the game, I can get to your level\"\n\nShe said \"no, don't, it's over now\" At this point I was on the couch beside her and she leaned in to give me a hug.\n\nThe whole room was fading to white as if it were the end of a flashback in a movie.\n\nThen I found myself walking back into the room, and she was sitting on the other side of the couch where I was and there's a new girl sitting where she used to sit,\n\nmy girl didn't want to fully acknowledge me but kind of looked over with a glance that conveyed\n\n\"I don't want to talk to you\"\n\nLike she was mad at me for what I did.\n\nthe other girl was probably aware that something happened between me and the first girl due to her acting similarly, They looked over at each other,\n\nMy girl said \"just go, you don't belong here\" as the dream was fading to white and I could feel myself waking up I said:\n\n\"I'm sorry it had to be this way\".\n\nSo that was just the first dream that I had a while ago, the one that I just had last night went like this:\n\nThis dream also started with me playing the Wii U, both times it was a Super Mario game\n\nA lot of the earlier part of the dream is pretty fuzzy but at some point I ended up walking with that same girl through her neighborhood at night, which looks like it was close to my irl neighborhood but was in a spot where it couldn't exist in real life.\n\nShe was telling me about the different houses and said that one of them is where the Beastie boys lived\n\nAt this point when I was writing down this dream I started to describe the girl, and I happened to describe her as \"remarkably slender\" just as I did when I wrote down the first dream (without realizing that was how I previously described her)\n\nI said she looked like an average girl my age but was very beautiful.\n\nI can still picture her face.\n\nWithin the dream I couldn't remember where I'd met her.\nShe kind of felt like a childhood friend that I'd recently reunited with. Within the dream I was actually intending on asking her how we had met.\n\nAt some point I think she realized that it was getting so late that she should go home. (I think that happened before this next part) A portion of the night sky opened up, well I guess it more looked it turned pink as if a movie projector was shining on it, and some character that I could only assume to be the girl's father appeared \n\nI am retroactively picturing her father as the king of all Cosmos from the katamari games.\n\n He said it is time (my child?) to return to the world of toys, a child's room where everything is a toy. (He really hammered in the point that they're all toys) my girl looked at me with eyes that conveyed that her secret was out.\n\n(So it's worth noting that both of these dreams point out that this girl isn't real, because she was explicitly stated to be imaginary in the first one, then she was explicitly stated to be a living toy in the second one) (\"living toy\" in the Toy Story sense I guess, not like a robot)\n\nWe turned and walked towards her house. She explained that every morning she always has to go back to her world in which she's a toy.\n\nWhen we got to her house it was kind of like one of those houses that used to be a camper and was converted into an actual house.\n\nThe girl said \"I have to go back now\" and walked through the screen door which I guess was some kind of a portal or barrier between the worlds, she literally walked through it without opening it.\n\nI asked her if we could hug through the portal.\n\nWe both reached out to hug but I couldn't reach my arms through, but she could, so she hugged me very tightly and then said good bye.\n\n\nThat's the end of the dream.\n\n\n\nWhile I was looking through that app where I have written down my dreams in I even found two other instances of meeting \"some girl\" in a dream, I hadn't even realized that until reading through them earlier today.\n\none was just an offhand mention that probably didn't mean anything.\n\nAnd in the other dream her and I were both young kids, in a play center.\n\nI don't know if it was the same imaginary girl in those two instances but they were worth mentioning nonetheless.\n\nCould anyone figure out what's going on here?\n\nWhy do I keep having dreams about this same imaginary girl?\n\nWhat could this mean / say about me?"

I dreamt that my grandmother passed away, but that wasn't the part that struck me as odd. \n\n\nI was in some type of office waiting area where everything was a shade of brown or tan in a yellow-scale coloring. Think of more modern interpretations of the 70s in movies, that type of coloring. \n\n\nTo my left there's a lady with glasses saying \"how do we tell her she passed?\" Right after she says it we catch each others eye. She comes over to me and I start to cry saying \"at least she's not in pain anymore\". I think about how I have to call my family and break the news while she goes to grab something that my grandma left for me. \n\n\nIn the box are 2 rings. The first one is solid gold and intertwined almost like the marriage symbol. The 2nd one, that I spent the most time staring at, was also two rings in one. Only one side had a jagged pink stone in the middle and the other was again, solid gold. It was also connected by a hinge, as if I was supposed to snap it into place so it would lay one on top of the other. \n\n\nAll I kept thinking was \"why would she leave this to me?\". I've never known my grandmother to wear rings and I couldn't think of anything to connect the rings to her. As I kept staring at the rings I'm slowly becoming more aware that this is a dream and I can finally hear my alarm that had been going off for 35 minutes. I woke up at 4am and haven't gotten it off of my mind since."

I graduated in 2021 so we haven't spent significant time together since then. \n\nI don't keep a dream journal so there are some instances that I can't remember, but here is a back story of who this person is and then a reccurance of the dreams I can remember. \n\nMy friend: Josie and I were friends since 5th grade. We were very close through middle school and the beginning of highschool. Then, I made some bad choices and our friendship fell apart. By senior year we reformed a tentative friendship but she admitted we would never be as close as we were. I accepted that, as there were consequences to my actions. We still had inside jokes and talked about the movies we liked together. We were both pretty stubborn people so we would bicker a lot. We graduated and said goodbye on good terms. I've seen her while home over break a few times. I haven't seen her since last summer. Now over the past month she keeps appearing in my dreams. \n\nDream 1: She got hired at my job and moved into the apartment directly below mine. (This dream is the furthest away and the details are fuzzy) \n\nDream 2: We were running away (I don't know what from, perhaps our home town, that neither of us liked??) and got a hotel and just... hung out? \n\nDream 3: (I remember this one this most clearly) One of my profs commented on how I actually bought the textbook and I tried to explain why, saying that I had ADHD and that the paper textbook was easier to focus on. In my dream she was sitting at the desk next to me and disputed me, essentially implying that that wasn't a good reason. \n\nNone of these dreams seem connected except for Josie being in them. \n\nDoes anyone have any ideas on why these dreams are happening or what they mean?"

I don‚Äôt remember what the groups did I think we just played a bunch of games inside? There was like this cafeteria and the. Next to it with three entrances was this safe room I guess ? We entered it for a game. And it had like pool and couches and TVs and shit. It was entirely white but the safe room had like this purple lighting. First game I remember was one where we just ran around and the group to get all their members in the safe room first won, I kinda cheated because I camped next to the door to the safe room and just ran inside when the game started. It had like these small tunnels and halls, Kinda like the inside of a slide or whimsical hallway. The whole building was like that actually it was just square rooms and then slide tunnels and whimsical halls, but this room especially had them. All the group bedrooms were just like down a hall I think ? I don‚Äôt know I just kinda teleported into one, but the second game I remember was basically just hide and seek and some kid said I couldn‚Äôt go in the safe room. I think there was also a bathroom in there but I could be misremembering. In the safe room I think there was like this blanket stuffed animal thing that I chopped the tail off of because I wanted it or something. It was supposed to be like our last day there or something. I ended up following some kid (like I mean probably not even in their double digits) on the star group to give them their stuffed animal‚Äôs tail back and they just said thanks and I just kept following them, they were giving me a piggy back ride for some reason, I asked them if I could sleep in their group bedroom that night and they just brought me there. It was like a small white room with half the floor being elevated by a two step staircase I think, all the lights were off tho so I couldn‚Äôt tell, but I couldn‚Äôt sleep so I asked the kid about it and they pulled out a bottle of alcohol I guess the label didn‚Äôt say it was alcohol it said it was something water I don‚Äôt remember what the first word was so I drank it and literally nothing happened so I just went back to the safe room instead of my group‚Äôs bedroom for some reason and just continued drinking there until I fell asleep.\n\nBasically the same stuff as last time (TW for fire, perversion ? and animal death)\n\nThese haven‚Äôt happened lately but I know I still think about them from time to time so maybe they could still affect my dreams idk\n\nI‚Äôm a white autistic transmasc (non binary) AroAce (though I‚Äôve begun questioning the ace part) as well as some other queer gender stuff (xenos, neos, you get the picture) minor with both ISTP and 6w5 personality types. Some stuff that‚Äôs generally happened to me ‚Äúrecently‚Äù was that my house burnt down, which caused the disappearance and dead assumption of one of my cats, this one‚Äôs more sensitive but you read the warnings: I ended up finding out my step brother was watching me through a crack in my door (and as I described it in the TWs it was for that reason). I also recently started going to church, I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of it, think it‚Äôs kinda boring, but my mom says I‚Äôm a good sport about it. I recently got a new online friendgroup and I‚Äôve been growing ever more impatient with things I like because they haven‚Äôt been updated in literal years. I think that‚Äôs all ?

I logged into an old google account and everything on the screen was me being abused by a family member. I‚Äôd type something in and all the images on the image search were of him sexually abusing me in various different places. As I tried to delete these photos, there were pop-ups with more and more of them‚Ä¶ then I was at a band trip, and I got in a fight with this kid (who I actually got in many physical altercations with in middle school and high school). Before the fight the band director had been taking orders from the kids for what they wanted to eat and I was the only one who wasn‚Äôt asked what I wanted nor could I seem to say anything about it. I was super frustrated and the boy I got in a fight with found it entertaining. The band director stood in between us so we couldn‚Äôt fight, so I grabbed his phone off of the counter, and shattered it. I decided to distance myself, and walked into the back of the building. When I got to the back of the building there were different rooms from my childhood. My moms ex-boyfriend‚Äôs basement, my grandpas kitchen, my brothers bedroom, the extra room in my first childhood home (which me and my twin sister slept in a lot). As I walked through these rooms, I seen kids walking out from behind curtains and bathroom doors really fast going past me and laughing at me."

I fell asleep holding my girlfriend. Once I finally fell asleep, it was like I awoke into the middle of a paradise. My actual surroundings seemed quite vague, which I believe means that they weren‚Äôt what was important at that time. From what I gathered, my surroundings were that of an oasis. Green grass, trees, everything full of life. It was the most peaceful I‚Äôve ever felt in my entire life. It felt like home. No pain, no hurt, just happiness and love. I was walking down a path in the grass and I noticed to my left that there were kids playing. It was more peripheral than in my direct line of sight, so I never truly ‚Äúsaw‚Äù them. Ahead I saw a woman, and she was probably in her mid twenties, around my age. We approached each other, and as she faced me she said ‚Äú Hey! It‚Äôs finally your first time here, congratulations!‚Äù We walked a short while and sat down. She sat to my left and I got a good look at her. She had long almost dirty blonde hair, bright blue eyes, red lips, and bright white teeth. I noticed that she had stickers on her face. As if she was playing with the kids I noticed when I first arrived. I kept studying her face and saw that there was something else, specifically her skin. It almost looked as if she had this silver/gold/blue skin like armor that covered around the under side of her jaw, and I saw some almost to her cheek bones. Then, the paradise I was in turned to a vibrant sapphire blue and white surrounding. No land, nothing in sight. I saw her arm and it looked injured. I asked her what happened to her arm but I don‚Äôt fully remember her response. After that, I was suddenly lying down, and I felt myself holding my girlfriend again. As I recognized that, the woman said to me ‚ÄúWe will see you soon!‚Äù To which I then felt what seemed like every single ounce of emotional pain a human could go through, and because of that I felt a suddenly jolt of severe full body physical pain. I woke up out of my sleep and almost jumped out of my skin. Still holding my girlfriend. I still feel the effects. Please help me figure this out."

I haven't been consuming much of their content lately, so this came pretty out of the blue in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, I can't remember the exact details. At first, I think I was working at a hotel - I don't know if it's the same one I work at now, I'm a front desk agent - but he was at the desk with a group of people (one was a lady, and I remember thinking that they could be a couple, but nothing else ever came of it). I don't remember much else of it but I remember him standing there very very clearly like he was some kind of beacon. He was quite literally almost glowing, and the other people with him were almost gray and muted compared to him. I remember he was wearing a dark hoodie with the hood pulled over his head and a pair of shorts, and he was shifting around in front of the desk like he was nervous and wouldn't look me in the eye.\n\nThen the scene changed or at least I don't remember what exactly lead up to this but next thing I remember we were on a couch I think? We were cuddling and talking with a TV on in the background in a dark room, but I don't remember what we were talking about. It felt so comfortable and real and I remember vividly thinking to myself as I was curled up against him and stroking his hair that \"I feel like I'm dreaming but I'm not, this is real and that's pretty cool.\" \n\nI remember I stopped stroking his hair for a second and moved my hand for something because I was on the verge of falling asleep in the dream. I remember he grabbed my hand and put it back on his head so I'd keep scratching and I thought it was the cutest fucking thing I'd ever seen in my life and I'd do anything for him. I remember that I moved away to get comfortable on another part of the couch and he pulled me back to him. Once again I thought he was adorable, and then I fell asleep in the dream.\n\nWaking up was weird because I still felt like I was in the dream, sleeping on the couch with him. But when I came around a little more I realized that it was a dream and I was awake in my bed, alone, and I've never felt so empty waking up from a dream before, nor have they ever felt so real even though the details were hazy.\n\nI haven't given much thought or priority to relationships or having a boyfriend or anything. Never wanted one, don't really enjoy or consume romantic content or anything, and I personally think it too exhausting to deal with at this point in my life due to personal stuff. I'm also an asexual woman, and so the idea of dating in a mostly sexual world is another reason I avoid relationships all together.\n\nSo why am I suddenly having a dream like that and feeling so sad that it wasn't real after all and there is no feasible chance in hell that I'd ever even meet that person, let alone have a relationship with them? I've always been comfortable on my own, but now I'm suddenly feeling like something is missing and I do not like it lmao. I've been thinking about this all day and it's my damn day off.\n\nHas anyone else had a dream similar to this?"

After I was in room like a dressing room with a mirror on a dresser looking at myself feeling alittle ugly but realized it was the reflection on my face from something white.

    "body": "So last night I had a really specific and vivid dream. I saw that I had something like a small stick peeking out of my ear and quickly realized it was a huge bug and its leg was peeking out. The leg was really big, it was maybe the size of a q tip that was visible outside. I also remember the feeling of having something inside and how I was basically deaf on my right ear, couldn't hear anything. I tried pulling it out but it was extremely hard so I called my mom, which is an interesting choice of a person, and she did her best to get it out but shr only managed to break a part of it and pull it out, leaving the rest of the bug trapped inside with nothing to pull with anymore. I also tried googling it in my dream and google said that you should wait 5-6 days for it to come out by itself part by part, it would apparently like melt or spmething. It was so disgusting and I remember feeling horrified, even tho it didnt really hurt but the idea of a bug being in there was awful. Im not sure, BUT I feel like it was a bug similar to maybe a wasp, even thp again I couldnt see it so it was just what my dream told me and what feeling it gave. \n\nFor a little context, the last two years have been quite turbulent with my parents, my mom going from almost disowning me to having a nice relationship even if whenever I visit her I feel like on tiptoes and Im always waiting for something to change and become bad again. It was really interesting to dream about her being the only person helping me with the bug when in real life she hasnt been there for me in that way."

    "body": "Recently, I've been having dreams that I feel like I already know the story to. And part of me can't tell if it's from a dream that I have had previously or its part of the same dream. A few weeks ago, I had a dream I was in an abandoned prison with my buddy, and we were paranormal investigators. Through our investigation, we found an anomaly, and object some strong force was attached to. Down the hall the anomaly showed itself to us, and started counting down from 10. And we started running, my buddy snatched a photo of its disembodied face. And we ran as fast as we could put of the prison. And in my dream, me and my buddy said it was the most wild Paranormal investigation we've ever had. From what I remember it was a lot scarier, and had more story to it than that. Well last night, I had another paranormal investigators dream. It was my buddy and I, and a few other people. This time we were investigating a house that had a murder in it. The victim was burnt to death. I found a spongebob plush that had a demon attached to it, and in the kitchen appeared a girl. And she started talking to us like a normal human and in my dream I actually felt compassion for her. I asked her was she a murderer, and she said no she was the victim. I was chatting and even laughing woth he'd, until we heard a huge boom from the upper floor. It scared us all. Then for some reason we went looking through our binder from previous investigations. And in the binder was THE PICTURE FROM MY DREAM A FEW WEEKS AGO. As we started looking at the picture we noticed the girl had the same face shape and structure as the entity in the photo. And then I said, \"oh my God its the entity from the prison.\" She turned into the entity and said \"surprise!\" And started counting down as we all started running out if the house. She grabbed me and tried to drag me back into the house as I was screaming for help. I then threw the entity in a hole in the back yard and covered her up with dirt and buried her. \n\nSo my question is 1. How come I'm having two connected dreams\n\nAnd 2. What do these dreams mean?"

I was 10-11 at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt starts with me being in this white ‚Äúspace‚Äù (it was not a room as it had no bounds) and all that filled this place was this bright whiteness, and it was the purest form of white my brain could comprehend. I was the only thing in this place. I became aware that I was \\*me\\*, I know that sounds weird but it was like my physical conscious body got transported into this place. All of a sudden, the voice began to talk to me. The ‚Äúvoice‚Äù did not have a physical being and I could not pin point exactly where it was coming from, as it sounded like it was coming from everywhere. All I remember about the voice was that it was deep and male. Even though I couldn't see it, I could tell it was some sort of powerful being, and that it was far older than me. It began to ask me questions, such as: \"what is your name\" \"how old are you\" \"who are your family members\" \"where are you right now\" \"what day is it\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bizarre thing is that it was specifically asking me questions about my \\*actual\\* self, not my dream version. Something to note too was that I was not afraid of this being, in fact, I felt completely calm and safe. I answered all of its questions truthfully, except my location. I told it I was at my mum‚Äôs, (however, when I answered I fully believed I was there). I could even see myself at my mum's, and feel myself on my bed, despite the fact I was not.Unfortunately that is all of the conversation I could remember, but I know we talked for longer. I then remember hearing two other voices, but it was coming from the real world. At first I couldn‚Äôt recognise them, but then I realised it was my dads and his then girlfriend. They were telling me to wake up.The being was saying its goodbyes to me, being soothing and calming, but I did not want to wake up. I was begging the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù to let me stay but of course, I woke up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt really sticks out to me as at that point in my life I was suffering from chronic nightmares and rarely had any ‚Äúgood‚Äù dreams, which is what made this one unique. I'm not sure if I was lucid dreaming or not."

But this is one of my biggest interests. This dream was one of those dreams that I really wish was real. In the 80s was a pizza place called showbiz pizza place, and later was converted into chuck e cheese. In the animatronic community, everyone is always trying to get their hands on showbiz pizza animatronics and fix em up and stuff. Well I had a dream wjere I was moving into a new house with my family, and I'm not sure how it got there, but in my room was a showstage full of all the showbiz pizza characters without cosmetics (costume). It was just almost mech. I can't remember of I bought it in the dream or not, but I was worried my dad was gonna be mad. I started gathering up money to fix these guys, replacing cylinders and making cosmetics. One night when I had some of the characters all fixed up, I realized that with the showstage was all the original like, computers to run the show. My family all gathered around saying how they remembered the old pizza place and i played a show for them. I remember I played multiple while I was just so happy that all of it was mine. And then I woke up, because you know that's just what had to have happened. But it felt so real.

I haven't seen any of the horrible things people sometimes see during SP, but it's a topic I had already read quite a bit about since it has happened to me a few times. I remember thinking \"no problem, remain calm and you will eventually wake up\". That part is foggy but I think I just woke up after a while, and then fell asleep again, and I vividly remember the dreams that followed\n\n\\- The first one is not super interesting, it involved airplanes, I was a passenger in a plane where they had computer screens in place of windows, and what as displayed on the screens did not match the movement of the aircraft, it felt like we were speeding towards our death for what felt like an eternity. I remember seeing two pilots being carried out by doctors through the plane's central aisle and people panicking. Then somehow we land and I find myself flying (like a bird, with no airplane, I remember trying to understand how to \"control\" my movement through the air) through random French towns (that I don't know nor ever went to). I remember landing in Nice while we (two close friends appeared there after the landing) needed to take a connection to Paris to go somewhere in the middle East.\n\n\\- And then I remember vividly talking to my mother, who passed away last year to cancer. It's the first time that I remember dreaming of her since then (again, I almost never remember my dreams). I remember being fully convinced that she was there alive, talking to me, and I was completely confused about why we had a funeral, since she was obviously alive and well.\n\nIn a weird way, it didn't feel like a dream. Feels like I was actually talking to her, and that she's out there somewhere.\n\nThe fact that this all happened during a fool moon makes this even stranger.

    "body": "I can't shake the feeling from this weird dream I had last night and I was hoping to get some insight. For some context, I am very spiritual and my dream involved some kind of spell/ritual.\n\nAll I remember is that me and my mother got into some kind of argument and I ended up going to the store to get something. At the store, I met an older lady who was also spiritual and near the check out lanes she showed me this spell/ritual that could help me with what I was going through (I think it was I could set an intention/make a wish of some kind). I don't recall how she knew I needed help or why this started but she showed me how to do the spell/ritual: I would have to find a gathering of ants, find the queen, and spread sulfur on top of her and around the other ants. I remember hearing so clearly the ants eating the sulfur and I think their queen (not 100% sure on the queen being eaten though). Then she had me take my own hair and for some reason I didn't take the hair from my head rather I had a bundle of hair from when I was blonde and it was fried and crunchy like it had been when I went blonde -- she took the hair, had me set my intention of what I wanted out of the experience, and sprinkled the hair on top of the ants and they started chewing at it. I remember my intention being something along the lines of wanting to find my authentic self and feel comfortable with who I am. I ended up crying (in the dream and in real life because I'm very physically reactive while I'm sleeping) and my mom appeared angry and we argued while I cried. I felt like my chest was constricting, like something had been unlocked and was now suffocating me. That's when I woke up.\n\nI don't know if this is just some weird dream I had but because of my spirituality, I'm inclined to believe this might mean something more because of how much its effecting me emotionally in my waking life. Anyone have any ideas of what this might mean??"

    "body": "The dream started with me talking to this girl from work, she was telling me about how I should throw a party. Then I remember driving home at night and seeing like 100 people outside my house, waiting to be let in. I thought \"wtf\" in the back of my mind. I then make my way through the crowd to the front door. I remember saying something along the lines of \"Do not slam into each other and break stuff, and \"if you f\\*ck with my dogs, I will beat the sh\\*t out of you\" \n\n(I've never actually \"beaten the sh\\*t out of anyone\" but if I see someone hurting an animal that would change). \n\nSo I unlock the door and walk inside. The first thing I noticed was the sound of the microwave being on. I walk into the kitchen and see that there is food in it and it's been heating it. At this point I like recalled putting it in there before leaving that morning (I didn't actually dream that part). But it had like 6 number slots instead of the usual 3 so my guess is that I added too many zeros when I put it in. \n\nAnother thing I noticed was a TON of bubbles all over the floor outside the kitchen. I followed the bubbles and realized it was coming from my dog's room (they have their own room). I instantly panicked and opened their door. They were in there submerged in the bubbles. There was some kind of pressure washing thing that had been on that was producing the bubbles. I turned it off and noticed how easy the button was to trigger. I surmised that someone left it on the floor and the dogs bumped it and it turned on. \n\nI pulled the dogs out of the bubbles. My beagle had shrank by like 50% and he looked SO SAD. I gave him a hug and inspected my other 2 dogs. They were seemingly fine. \n\nThe next thing I remember, I was in the basement listening to some band playing. There were tons of people. This security guard kept coming up to me and talking to me and I'd jump down from the ledge and accidentally land on his shoes every time. He wasn't talking to me about anything bad I was doing though. I'm guessing my dream self had hired him because he was reporting stuff to me. \n\nThe last time he talked to me he said something along the lines of \"Hey you need to come with me man, someone is trying to diss you\" (I don't think I've ever actually used the word \"diss\" so idk). Oh and he also told me to stop stepping on his shoes every time he talked to me.\n\nAs we walked up stairs he explained what he meant. He said that some people of the party claimed I would pay for anything, so they all went out to get food for themselves. Like they knew that's not what I meant and they tried it anyways. \n\nI went looking around the party and noticed all the people I actually knew were absorbed into their own groups and having fun. I felt kind of sad by this because I had been standing alone in the basement. I felt abandoned in a way, if that makes sense. I thought at least surely the friend from work would hang out with me but no.\n\n As I walked around, only one person acknowledged me. They patted me on the back as I walked by. The weirdest thing is that I think it was myself. Like a separate me. I didn't take an active look at them but I did notice they were wearing a shirt that I wear a lot IRL. \n\nI made my way over to a makeshift bar. The seats were all full. I looked at the bartenders and they were talking about how something had finally arrived. One of them then excitedly held up what I think was a $3 bill. (yes I know that's not a real thing but still). I woke up pretty much after that. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHonestly as I was typing this out I found some meaning in it. I think it related to my fears of being alone. The other night I had a dream that I was at work and everyone was a different person except 2. One of those 2 being the same girl from the post dream. The 2 who were the same were both telling me that they're leaving. And I was so scared of being the only one left. That everyone I knew was replaced. \n\nI feel like the post dream ties into that a lot. That I feel like there is nothing about me that people want to experience. So I'm always witnessing the conversations but never a part of them. \n\nAnd maybe I should just forget all of them because the only person who noticed me was quite possibly myself. Aside from the cool security guard."

Even during nightmares I can tell they're dreams.\n- no one, not even people I know IRL, have faces in any of my dreams, ever. I just know who they are. \n- I do tend to remember dreams, but not with this clarity. \n\nA few months ago I had a dream that started with me walking down a long hallway and opening a MASSIVE door. It was black but incredibly intricate. I met a few people (none of which had faces), and somehow got into an altercation with a couple of men. This....stunning \"person\" saved me. I could clearly see his face, and there was nothing remarkable about his features, he just radiated power. When I asked his name, he simply said \"Death\". We spent some time together and fell in love. He was incredibly kind, gentle, loving, protective, etc etc. He eventually revealed his \"true\" form to me. Intimidating, powerful, but not horror movie scary. And not the grim reaper. After revealing himself to me he cupped my face in his massive hands and said \"you are the embodiment of life. We have always co-existed, but I would like to continue the rest of eternity with you bringing life to my heart as well\". \nI haven't been able to stop thinking about that dream. I can remember every detail, down to how his hands felt on my face. Last night, I had what seemed to be a continuation of that dream. I opened that door again, and he was there waiting for me. He didn't bother with his human form this time, and he felt so warm and alive. The opposite of what I'd expect \"Death\" to feel like. He held me like I was made of glass and said that my presence made his necessary, but he was eternally grateful for having been created because it meant he met me. He kissed me, said he would see me soon, and then I woke up. I could feel his lips against mine for a few seconds after I woke up. \n\nI frequently have really strange dreams (even involving zombies \"procreating\"). This takes the cake though.

I had to sit and think about it over and over before grabbing my laptop.\n\n4 June 2023\n\r\nParts of the dream are separated in ‚Äúphases‚Äù because there are cuts in my dreams. Not\r\nentirely sure if it is normal for the dream sequence to randomly just act up and the things you\r\nsee change. It‚Äôs like skipping scenes in films. So I will be writing things as I saw them, and\r\ntrust that I tried very hard to recollect every detail. Some may have just been added to fill in\r\nthe gaps but this is the overall drift I get from the dream.\n\r\nPhase One\n\r\nI was working on a cruise ship, a peculiar job for me. Certain tasks included getting tickets\r\nfrom a machine as part of a security measure. It seemed mundane until we found out that\r\nthe tickets were somehow compromised and falsified, thus all the data we have been\r\ninputting somewhere were incorrect. There had been a breach and our supervisor is trying to\r\nfigure out who had done it and what would be the consequences of the error.\n\r\nNeedless to say, it is impossible to discern what kind of job this actually is and what the\r\npurpose of all that is.\n\r\nHowever, it came to pass that I was working alongside my mother. We were together for the\r\nfinal task, and she tells me to get a ticket before we get on a platform atop the room we were\r\nin. It looks more like an escape vent that leads outside the ship. Knowing the ticket machine\r\nis unreliable, I simply said no and went ahead to the surface without her. The ship starts to\r\nsink and the room fills with water. She makes it out alright.\n\r\nPhase Two\n\r\nIt appears we live in a ferry boat, and I planned on moving out. My mother and I, just like in\r\nreal life, have a tumultuous relationship in my dream. My little brother in the middle of the\r\nchaos between us, is unable to choose sides but sticks with mother. I was off the boat for a\r\nwhile and discussing what I want my future to be like with my boyfriend. Later, I proceed to\r\ngo back to the boat and pack my things. I needed to time it to when mother is not around to\r\navoid further conflict. Alas, she was around and I was unaware, so there was a lot of\r\nbickering. I could see the hatred in both of our faces.\n\r\nWhile I was leaving, my little brother approaches me and apologises on mother‚Äôs behalf. He\r\ntells me she doesn‚Äôt mean any of the cruel things she said towards me. I invite him to move\r\nout with me so he can have a more peaceful life. Again, he is unable to decide.\r\nHe was involved in a contest of sorts held by a university, and the event was held in the\r\nboats docked at the marina. This event took place before I planned on moving out. My\r\nbrother won the contest (I really do not know what it is though) and having found out about\r\nthis I was proud of him, as well as cheered him on. He is indeed gifted. The prize would have\r\nbeen a generous amount of money, but the university held back on the winnings. They\r\nrefused to give it to my brother, had both mother and brother sign a non-disclosure\r\nagreement, as well as threatened their lives if they ever spoke about the winnings not being\r\ngiven.\n\nThey are under duress, and every time there would be a little bit of interaction between my\r\nfamily and other people from the outside, they are being watched closely by the\r\norganisation. I suddenly have a vision that makes my heart sink, but the reason for this\r\nemotion is unclear. The vision was fireworks at the marina. Seems harmless.\r\nA celebration of sorts was held at the marina later on. My boyfriend and I were watching\r\nfrom the hill overlooking the docks, and there it was. A fireworks display. An explosion\r\nhappens minutes after and the ferry boat we lived on is sinking. My brother barely makes it\r\nout alive, mother is nowhere to be found. I assume the worst.\r\nMy boyfriend and I try to take my brother to safety, we are driving to someplace. But a freak\r\naccident happens and we lose him. Distraught, I begin to consult with authorities to\r\ninvestigate everything that has happened so far. The boats, the accident, the university‚Äôs\r\nwithholding of funds from winners.\n\r\nPhase Three\n\r\nI am no longer present in the next scenes, staff workers from neighbouring boats at the\r\nmarina talk about the events. One of the cooks/kitchen staff members began to disclose the\r\nsecrets of the university (about them withholding the funds to winners and the threats). She\r\nsays some of the eventgoers were silenced about an incident regarding a cake. This mystery\r\ncake contained something that did not belong there. She was encouraged to pass the\r\ninformation over to investigating authorities. She expressed she would rather take a look at\r\nthe cake, as she heard it was hidden somewhere in one of the docked boats.\r\nThey go onto the boat where the main event was held and after a thorough but discreet\r\nsearch, they find the cake. Covered in cloth. After having lifted the cloth, they see what\r\nappears to be a normal cake. Plain chocolate cake. No frostings, no toppings. Just round\r\nchocolate bread. Some of them start cutting slices and help themselves with the cake. But\r\nthe more they cut, the more they find there is something strange about it. One last slice,\r\nacross the entire cake, cutting it in half, reveals it contains some parts of a dismembered\r\ninfant. Unfortunately, before this reveal, some of them have already consumed bits of this\r\nmonstrosity. So they gag and retch. One of the cooks grins for some reason.\n\r\nLast Phase\n\r\nThe culprit is among the kitchen staff present in the previous scene. He is shown throwing a\r\nbaby into a sink filled with boiling water. I could hear this baby cry bloody murder.\n\r\nAnd then I woke up disturbed, perhaps traumatised by the nightmare.\n\nInterpretation welcome and in fact, invited. I appreciate any help understanding this dream. I am not at all taken aback by how vivid my dreams are, cause they often are and I'm used to it. I have already made a habit of dream journaling, but I am not good at interpreting my own dreams."

I am in bed and become aware of someone scraping irregular shapes into my lower back. My back is incredibly sensitive so this starts out uncomfortable but becomes painful. I twitch away and the talon follows a moment later, just when I'm starting to relax. Eventually I realize my tormentor is an old hag with a disfigured face, as though she was wearing a person suit and someone ripped the bottom half of the face off, revealing green skin and oddly shaped teeth. \nI know what's going to happen next and though I beg her to leave me alone and try to crawl away, my attempts grant me no relief or real distance. She sinks her teeth into my lower back, biting again each time I move. Again I feel it on my body and shift in my actual bed but it takes a long time to wake up and get enough distance from the dream that I don't immediately fall back into it. There were points in the nightmare where she looked or acted like my male fiance, but only out of the corner of my eye, never when I looked at her full on.\n\nI've had similar nightmares, where I tell people no or stop and they don't listen. I suppose it has to deal with not feeling like I have any say in what happens to me, or just in general in life. But I'm not sure why this one keeps coming back. Why an old hag? Why the biting and scratching?"

I'm taking whole bottle of gin that had no effect on her, Iwasn't drinking in this dream and rarely do anyway. \n\nIt just felt very different to any other \"met a girl\" dream I've had, but the alcohol was the big difference.."

    "body": "The dream I had last night was intriguing. It took place in what I would assume to be a Mediterranean area (I would say Spain as snippets were in Spanish), I was with these 3 Argentinian girls who I haven't seen for 2 years. The weird thing is I wasn't super close with them, they were just former classmates. I then left them, walked through a Greek style church, and emerged at a train station.  At the station, I was rapidly approached by strangers each speaking a different language. Some I could understand, while some were very different. I'm not too sure of this dream's meaning, but I'm curious to find out the interpretation."

Sometimes I'm with or see someone I know or don't know. It's kind of like a loop as I just keep moving &amp; going through the same scenario in the dream. \n\n\nIMO it kind of mirrors my real life as I don't like the situation I'm in or people I have to deal with so it's like I'm trying to get away from that &amp; or looking for something new &amp; better."

    "body": "I (M) was riding passenger in my girlfriends car as she drove through a forest at night. It starts with us taking a left turn, the road leads us past an old house in a small clearing. It's a little run down with windows of blue and yellow stained glass, it appears ordinary but something about it captures my attention. Right as we are about to drive out of the clearing and back into the dense forest there is a blinding flash of white light, panic immediately floods my body. Before I even realize what is going on my girlfriend screams out that she cannot see and I tell her to \"shut the car off\" so that we don't make any noise or light in case this is some kind of trap. A moment goes by and we regain our eyesight to find we had gone off the road and ended up beside the house. She starts the car again and starts to drive away screaming that she still sees a red light, however I cannot take my eyes off the house to see the light. I woke up very suddenly and in tears. What's particularly odd about this dream to me was that it was in the 1st person as I rarely dream from that perspective"

We grew close emotionally, so that I could see her more fully; that she was neurotic and self conscious, and I was hesitant but also thought it was ok, and I loved the complexity of her emotional life.  It was like I saw years into the future of a relationship‚Äîpast the honeymoon phase, and I found despite the hardship of her emotional instability; I was pleased.  We were on a road trip together.  There were others, but hazy and as background to what played out between the two of us.\n\nBut I‚Äôve never really spoken to this woman.  There might be some slight chemistry there.  We smile at each other, but it was a strange dream, and even more bizarre was seeing her at work today and smiling as we always do‚Äîafter all we‚Äôd been through.\n\nI can‚Äôt stop thinking about this dream.

    "body": "[this is a crosspost from r/Dreams] \n\nHi r/DreamInterpretation, I think I need help figuring this one out because I've had basically the same dream at least three times now. Which is really weird since I rarely ever remember my dreams.\n\nFor some context, my dog died on December 27th, so relatively recently. She was a sweet old girlie with a lot of health problems, it was her time. I loved her with all my heart and since I'm on the younger side (and very forgetful) I barely have any memories of life without her in it. That's caused some weirdness in the grieving process, since I'm sort of stuck within the denial phase since I have to rewrite my concept of home life without my dog in it.\n\nAnyways, over the past month or so I've had this weird dream about my dog a few times. The \"plot\" of what happens in the dream is pretty straightforward, with me mostly just doing normal stuff around the house, though not interacting with my parents much (we live in the same house).\n\nThe weird part is that for some reason, my parents bought/adopted multiple copies of the same dog, specifically my dead dog. The copies are slightly off from the real one visually in coloring, but I don't think that matters. \n\nAll of these doggie clones act and look exactly like my dead dog did, they just end up doing different things at different times. The number of dogs in the dreams fluctuates constantly, the lowest I remember being 3 and the highest being around 13. And this isn't just a weird dream quirk, \"dream-me\" actually reacts to the fact that the number of dogs is constantly changing which is really friggin weird.\n\nIn fact, \"dream-me\" seems to be fully aware that none of this was normal, and I feel really vaguely unsettled throughout the dream. Just that weird, distant \"something is fundamentally wrong with this\" feeling that you get sometimes. Other than that distant feeling, \"dream-me\" is usually pretty comforted by the fact that I'm surrounded by a bunch of sweet, sleepy puppers throughout my day.\n\nHowever, \"dream-me\" did approach my parents about the weirdness of the situation a couple times, to which (I think) either they didn't respond at all or just dismissed it like it was normal or something.\n\nOther parts that might be somewhat relevant:\n- If I remember correctly, \"dream-me\" may be aware that the real dog is singular, and is dead\n- All the colors in the dream are muted to greyscale (or close to it, with light yellowish tints instead)\n- My house in the dream is somewhat different, looking more like an extended version of my poorly designed basement than the real thing\n\nI would really appreciate help in deciphering what the hell any of this means. The closest things that I can possibly glean from it would be\n1. I'm not over it (yeah probably)\n2. My subconscious thinks my parents aren't over it and are trying to replace my dog (maybe???)\n3. My subconscious wants me and my parents to know that my dog cannot effectively be replaced, it would feel wrong (possibly???)\n\nSo yeah thanks for reading through this weird clone-dog dream.\n\nTL;DR: My dog died and now I'm getting recurring dreams about sharing a house with 3-13 clones of her, what the hell does that mean"

One day, it struck me: Why not create an app to help us make sense of these nighttime tales? That‚Äôs how Dream ai was born.\n\nDream ai is your simple, easy to use, pocket-sized dream translator. You simply type in your dream, and the app does the rest, providing an interpretation and an image representing your dream.\n\nOne feature I‚Äôm excited about is the monthly calendar view, complete with dream-associated emojis for each day. It‚Äôs a unique and interactive way to connect your dreams to specific dates and observe patterns. Maybe you‚Äôll discover that stress dreams coincide with work deadlines or that happier dreams occur around the weekend. It‚Äôs a fun little experiment!\n\nDream ai is now ready for the world on the App Store. I‚Äôm looking forward to sharing it with the community here on r/DreamInterpretation. If you decide to give it a whirl, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts, experiences, and any intriguing dream insights you might uncover.\n\nHere‚Äôs the [App Store link](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dream-ai/id6448833078).\n\nThanks for letting me share my project with you.

Raining and camping for example and having to stay warm, or the wind rolling through the hills as a dim lantern is the only thing illuminating us in the tent. \n\nWhen the dreams are sexual they have an intensity and realness that makes it almost feel like it happened and a deeper energy between us somehow trickles into reality. \n\nWhat do these dreams mean? We‚Äôre both in committed relationships but the energy around them seems to be growing and they consistently happen once to twice a week."

Nonetheless I was disturbed. Eventually the little girl would take matters further and she would not only sever the nose of one child, but also her hand. At that moment I was filled with a combination of both terror and wrath, and this is where things become even stranger. For some reason, I took it upon myself to find the psychotic little girl and decided to sever her nose and her hand, just like she had done to the other children, almost as a way of delivering some kind of Justice.

One wedding was for my mom (she's been happily single and not dating for like 10 years) and the dress was a black skirt bottom but the top was a very revealing bejeweled/rhinestone string bikini. Very NOT my mom lol, and I was also supposed to pick out matching jewelry and buy enough sets for my sisters to have some also. The lady helping me could not find the second dress which was supposed to be for my college best friend's wedding. I was maid of honor for her real wedding 15 years ago lol, but since covid our friendship has really tapered off and I haven't talked to her in a while. So in the dream I started panicking and searching through the storage area and eventually the whole store trying to find this missing bridesmaid dress. That one was supposed to be a very traditional looking dress but in black. So I have one black bridesmaid dress I'm very iffy about and I'm frantically searching for another more traditional but also black bridesmaid dress. The two weddings were happening the next day, my mom's in the morning and my friend's in the evening. I didn't seem stressed about the timing, just about the dresses. Also my mom is unlikely to remarry and my friend is already happily married. Just an all around weird and stressful dream.\n\nA side note about weddings/marriage is that my husband I divorced last year but we reconciled and have recently been discussing getting remarried. I'm thinking there is a deeper connection here to that idea."

I'm guessing it was near some kind of train track field or something, maybe even right on top of it. \n\nAnyway in this dream my old technology teacher from high school was the one driving me home.

    "body": "TLDR at the end.\n\nThe earliest I can remember in the dream was going to this huge house for a get together with friends from a new church that invited me. The house had a large TV, a very spacious living room, a line of doors north the living room that lead to another part of the house, stairs on the east of the room that lead to the outside patio, three doorways southwest of the house the lead to three rooms each with a large stain glassed window of Jesus, and to the west of the house was a kitchen that had large stairs that lead up. In this house, there were about 8 girls around my age, a medium sized dog, and a man in his late 20s - early 30s with his wife and a buddy of his. The couple and his friend decided to leave the house for some reason and I was left alone in this house with the girls and the dog. At some point, I accidentally hurt the dog (not badly though, just made him yelp) and one of the girls grabbed the dog and yelled, \"I hope you never do that again. If you do that again I'll kill you. I'll kill your right here.\" In a fit of rage I screamed back, \"Well I hope you do. I HOPE YOU DO FUCKING KILL ME!\" At that moment I grabbed some of my things and ran up the stairs, however I was still missing my backpack. I looked behind me and saw the girl angrily grab an empty bottle of svedka and march up the stairs after me as I hurriedly fiddled with the shitty doorknob to the outside patio. Once I got out there the patio was mostly covered in smooth gravel with the occasional concrete squares and a metal grater close to the door that was falling in. I stood outside of the door as the girl who I pissed off as well as the other girls started throwing glass bottles at me and everyone of them missed me and shattered behind me. They were shouting at me as I was trying to explain to them that all I needed was my backpack and I would leave. A girl with blonde wavy hair walked out of the house and started shoving me and pushing her glass bottle into my arm and chest. At that moment, I realized that her pushes felt like nothing and a voice inside my head said \"You're dreaming\". I forcefully pushed her away and looked at the ground while I did it then looked back up only to realize the blonde girl disappeared. I looked back over at the door to see the girls staring back at me then shutting the door. I walked back into the house with the girls nowhere to be found and the dog peacefully sleeping on the floor. I walked back down the stairs and once I reached the bottom I noticed one of the girls peaking from behind one of the lines of doors from the north side of the room then slowly closing it. I realized now would be a good time to find my backpack and head home. This was when I looked into the different doorways that lead to the rooms with the stain glassed windows and thought, \"Damn, this house is huge.\" I walked into the kitchen only to be welcomed by the man and his wife and friend walking through one of the doors that lead outside. I told him about the backpack situation and he said I would get it back after the church service and lead me up the stairs in the kitchen and it was at that moment I realized I was shirtless. I covered my breasts with my arms and walked up the stairs to a huge chapel full of people. I sat down for a few moments then decided to just leave and maybe come back later once i was dressed. Once I got home and put a shirt on I noticed how absolutely filthy my room was. There were yellow and white stains on the carpet, the windows were covered in condensation on the inside, and both of my pet's tanks (I have am axolotl and a hamster) were disgusting. I also noticed that my axolotl's bubbler was on in his tank and half the water was gone. I quickly unplugged it then stared out the window because I noticed my mom's suitcase on the floor and she was nowhere to be found so u assumed she'd be coming home soon. I first saw a woman I didn't know walk up the stairs to my house and knocked on the door and stood there then I saw my mom. I turned around only to see her already walking up the stairs to my room and I explained the situation with the bubbler. She replied, \" oh its good for him\" to which I said, \"no, if you leave it on too long it stresses him out.\" I looked away and looked back only to see the bubbler on again and my axolotl vomiting became of it. Once again I turned it off and said \"Keep it off, I mean it.\" \"Oh, he likes it.\" \"I MEAN IT!\" Just then mom let out my old family dog who died 2 years ago. Her fur was completely white when it was usually brown and black and she could barely walk. She fell to the floor and started vomiting profusely with the occasional human-sounding burp in between gagging. Then I woke up. It was the craziest thing I ever dreamt.\n\nTLDR:\nI went to a big church house that housed 8 girls and a dog. I hurt the dog and the girls got mad and fought me. I realized I was dreaming when I didn't feel them hurt me. They ran off and spied on me in the house when I went looking for my backpack. The man who owned the house returned with his wife and I realized I was naked at this point. He told me I would get my backpack back if I went to a church service. I went home instead to put on some clothes. At home my room was filthy and my pets were sick. I got into an argument with my mom over it."

When i was in that street in my dream I get a call from my mother, that the person, name unknown, died in a car accident, I don't know who the person was, but i remember the strong feeling of disbelief and that that person is someone I  really loved and cared about, i felt it deep in my chest.\nMy mom picks me up, also dressed in black and drives me to the place where the accident happend which was a crossroad in my hometown. I remember pushing through the crowd of people and staring down at the road, and right here I saw crying, kind of animated eyes looking at me kindly and in a caring maner, I started crying hysterically and fell down on my knees and started touching the ground surrounding those eyes and at that moment I woke up all wet from crying. \nI've tried many times and asked many people to help me interpret this dream but nothing ever stuck to me or seemed to calm me down.

    "body": "Hi guys, I have been able to lucid dream for as long as i‚Äôve been able to remember‚Ä¶ it has never been something that i need to ‚Äútry‚Äù to do. in fact, i thought it was normal to be able to control your dreams each time you slept until my young friends told me otherwise. Not to trauma dump, but for context, I did not have the best of childhoods, and i genuinely think that my ability to control my dreams came from a subconscious need to control my real life. Usually in lucid dreams, I am able to completely take over. However recently, it has been harder for me to have complete control. I am aware that I am dreaming and actively trying to take control, but it‚Äôs like my subconscious is against me‚Ä¶ the best example is me and mirrors. Every time i pass a mirror, I am unwittingly enthralled by it. I stare at it for long amounts of time until my image becomes distorted. As i stare ahead straight faced, my reflection taunts me with a sadistic smile, inviting me to enter the mirror. Just like you see in the movies, I dip my finger and the mirror ripples, I am allowed to enter it. Each time i stick my head in, I see a world completely mirrored from the one dream me is currently in, with a dark blue tint. It feels cold and threatening. I pull my head out and continue on doing what I usually do (which is generally being the scarlet witch and fucking up my abusers with red squiggly doos) I was just wondering if any other fellow lucid dreamers have experienced something similar? it‚Äôs like one of the only things i unwillingly do in my dreams and i‚Äôd really like to know any type of theories you may have :)"

And she was telling me about this thing, which a person does or tells a priest in order to get closer with god or something.

After talking to a friend who doesn‚Äôt believe in dream interpretation, he said he feels like there is a meaning behind it and was actually interested in knowing all the details. \n\nSo the dream started out in a village. It was a small country area and there were like invisible walls around the town, no one came in, no one left. Except for the train that passed by. I was in arranged marriage by the heads of the town to this woman who was pregnant. She didn‚Äôt want to be married to me, but as ordered by the town we had to stick together. We were married because the single folk in the town were often murdered or targeted for crimes. As I was a visitor, it was safer to be married. There was murder, arson, thievery, it was plaguing the city. My wife and I arranged that we live together and I would help with the baby. I would go to work, turning a side eye to the people who were becoming victims to others crimes. I worked with this man that was awfully close to my wife and he would talk about my wife, giving me the sense he was the father to the unborn child. \n\nReturning to our house I told her it was a bad idea to show public affection especially around the travelers that caused chaos in the town. She wasn‚Äôt having it, she didn‚Äôt want my help no matter how much I tried. Eventually we made our way to a town meeting outside the train tracks. The mayor wanted to prevent travelers from entering the town if they mean harm, I turned to my wife to grab her hand but the mayor was killed. The vivid death lingers in my mind as the murderer grabbed hold of the passing train and was gone. I grabbed my wife‚Äôs hand and told her we had to go, but she shook her head and said she can‚Äôt leave and I have to go. Then I woke up. \n\nA lot has been going on in my personal life but I‚Äôm curious what the thoughts are so far."

Then I wake up in the dream, so I‚Äôm still dreaming, and I notice I‚Äôm in an unfamiliar house looking for my parents who are not there and neither are my dogs. I find out my parents are at the friend‚Äôs parents house and I walk over there because apparently we‚Äôre neighbors now. I thought they were consoling them but they were having a party this is when I realize I must‚Äôve dreamt about the friend dying. But I realize her parents don‚Äôt know where my friend is at and is calling her over and over again. There was a pit in my stomach hoping I was wrong. I take a seat next to my friend‚Äôs grandparents (who aren‚Äôt actually her grandparents) and they are fighting over a bag of chips. It stresses me out and I‚Äôm on the verge of tears.

So later my family and I leave and we go to the beach. I am playing in the water with my dogs when I see a shark and it‚Äôs coming towards the sand. I distract my dogs by making them run far away and I think surely we‚Äôll be okay once we get away from the shore until I realize after the shark scraped my leg with its teeth that the shark grew 4 little legs and was chasing us.

I'll dream of very detailed mazes/labyrinths, situations that don't make sense that I've never even heard of, seen, or experienced. I wake up so confused sometimes but always been this way...I've never had a \"normal\" dream. Is there a reason for this, can someone explain?"

He felt so real, so disgusting and I was completely terrified. \n\nI was looking at his feet to see if he is really \"real\" and his feet were naked, dirty. \n\nThen I felt like I have to kill him (for some reason), and I couldn't touch him with my hands because of how repulsive he was. Then the gun appeared in my hand, and I wanted to shoot him, but I couldn't. My fear was more stronger than my body and mind.\n\nMulholland Dr. is one of my all time favorite movies, I love David Lynch. This hobo in the movie scene behind the dumpster is for many people a pretty scary and terrifying moment. There are many theories about what this creature represents, but I'd say it's a strong sense of fear. \n\nHowever, I am currently going through some tough time in my life, and I'm struggling with anxiety and depression.

    "body": "I don‚Äôt know how to explain it so I will try my best. I will have a dream about murdering person A. I will have a few dreams in between the murder before I have another dream which picks up where the other left off, ish and normally has to do with people realizing I am probably the individual who committed the murder. I will then have a dream about murdering person B. A few dreams will go by and I will murder person C. The next dream will pick up from the murder of person B, again, normally in the investigation portion of the murder. I have already had a set of dreams for the murder of, let‚Äôs just call them, person 1, which has reached a conclusion where I end up in prison. I have not had a single dream about this, since it has reached a conclusion where I am in prison.\n\nThis doesn‚Äôt just happen with dreams pertaining to me murdering somebody, but for some reason this has been a common theme lately. My dreams occur in sequence or chronological order and in my dreams I always remember the last one and where I left off, like putting a VHS back in after you stopped at 3/4 of the way through. Some nights if I wake up and go back to bed, my dreams will just resume where they left off and if they don‚Äôt resume where they left off, they will resume in the same dream universe where the same things are happening if that makes sense. \n\nI‚Äôve never really tried to make sense of then as I‚Äôve always had really odd dreams. Most people call them nightmares, but I‚Äôve been having them since I was so young they don‚Äôt bother me. \n\nHonestly, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs really any sense to be made. I just wanted to tell someone about these dreams because they genuinely fascinate me.\n\nDo you experience some thing similar? I‚Äôd love to talk about it with people."

Their uniforms resemble dated tunics and golden shoulder pads.\r  \nMilitary members and other civilians start slaughtering the church members and clergy as the ‚ÄúCeremony begins‚Äù\r  \n(in my mind)  ‚Äúthis is the beginning of genocide‚Äù\r  \nI don‚Äôt run I don‚Äôt panic I just watch. After a few seconds I just sit down in a pew trying to understand the meaning of this dream.\r  \nI look to my right and there is this young woman (mid 20‚Äôs) she had blonde hair and she was beautiful. Her eyes were an amazing silver. We lock eyes and she stabs me in the right shoulder with an ice pick. I don‚Äôt react. I don‚Äôt feel it. We stay eyes locked. ( I AM MEZMORIZED BY HER EYES) \r  \nShe says, ‚Äúyour just gonna watch that. And not expect this to happen?‚Äù\r  \nshe takes it out and slashes in between my groin and abdomen. She gets up as our eyes are locked still\r  \nI say ‚Äú oh no, I understand‚Äù ( I still don‚Äôt react. I don‚Äôt move.) her eyes go from confident and filled with purpose. To confusion and sadness as she slowly walks away.\r  \n(BLACKOUT) -  I awake in real life ( in my mind ) ‚Äúthat cant be it. I want back in that dream‚Äù (im successful)\r  \nNow im in the basement of the church. I hear people being finished and begging for their life.\r  \n(in my mind) ‚ÄúI want to die in the sunlight, this doesn‚Äôt seem it‚Äù \r  \nI start fumbling and running into a catacomb like underground until I reach the end and im somewhat blinded by sunlight.

Who is this?‚Äù\r  \nI look at her. She looks back. Then speaks to the officer ‚Äú this is -------- ‚Äú( a name I can not pronounce or remember, it had an European and middle eastern feel to it )\r  \nThe officer is distracted by one of her friends. The blonde hands me a bill.\r  \n‚Äúgive this to him, he‚Äôll go away‚Äù.  ‚Äì I grab it.\r  \nI look at it. It has a 3 and 1\\\\2 numeral. And looks like a combination of a Euro and a Dinar. No visible governmental figure. ‚Äì he grabs it and says ‚Äúthank you sir‚Äù and goes about his day.\r  \nWe get to the hotel. All of sudden her friends have a man and they‚Äôre pushing him past the mud room. ( first entrance to take off shoes and etc, its essentially a front porch but enclosed )\r  \nOne of them says ‚Äú THIS MOTHERFUCKER JUST STARTED BEATING ME FOR NO REASON‚Äù \r  \nI close to the door to mudroom in assistance and they are stomping and beating this man senseless.\r  \nIm shaking my head up and down and (in my mind) ‚Äúthese girls are pretty fuckin‚Äô awesome‚Äù\r  \nI hear the blonde in the mudroom she‚Äôs audibly struggling and making noise and I hear herself slam herself against the wall a couple times in hesitation. Im confused thinking shes being attacked but its just her in there. She stabbed herself in the side 2 to 3 times with the help of the wall. ( I don‚Äôt think she had the heart to just straight up do it, she had to fall into the wall and force herself into it. )\r  \nI open the door quick and inquisitive; she perks up and try‚Äôs to hide what she just did. thinking a smile will make the cause for concern go away. \r  \nBLACKOUT ( A FUCKIN GAIN I awake. ---- as before i know there is still more. ) I fall back asleep.\r  \nNow were walking down the street all of us. Twilight is beginning . the brunettes are in front. im in the middle and the blonde is behind me a couple feet apart. The brunettes stop in their tracks with maps trying to assess where to go. so they stop. I stop just short of them. The blonde bumps into me because she didn‚Äôt notice. I can see her. Her eyes still amazingly silver but they‚Äôre filled with tears and pain, she‚Äôs wincing. \r  \nI approach and say. ‚Äúbreathe ( gesturing nose first and out the mouth) you need to breathe. Do it with me‚Äù (still gesturing) and the brunettes surround the blonde and I, in a hugging circle, and they‚Äôre helping to get her breathing under control. She‚Äôs got it down and it has seemed to work.\r  \nThen the blonde comes in to me and kisses me. THE most passionate kiss I have ever had (topping real life experiences) this lasted about 10-15 seconds. \r  \nI Awake. And I cant go back and see the rest of this out because I awoke 7 minutes before my alarm.\r  \nIt pains me that I cant. I just don‚Äôt understand any of it, but I want back in."

I intentionally leaned harder on the fence and it broke, releasing a black horse. The farmer or person that told me not to lean basically said you shouldn't of done that. I feel my mood at the time was cheeky and careless and I did not care about letting the horse loose. It quickly escalated and as I began to feel remorse and panic at the horse running and neying? Whatever noise horses make the sky grew red and black and the horse grew in size and then thunder and lighting was clashing and I could hear screaming from other people and the lightning started fires and the situation went cataclysmic almost with the horse being about as big as a school bus up on its hind legs with lighting flashing behind it and then I guess I was finally startled enough to wake up.\n\nJust looking for a analysis from a someone with alot of experience.

    "body": "So, just as I fell asleep I remember getting out of a car with a person whose face I do not remember very well. We were getting out of a car which had stopped at the edge of a forest, and for some reason we decided to wander in.\r  \n\r  \nWe walked for a decent amount of time until the weather started to get cloudy, and the enviroment got darker and more eerie... Suddenly, we got scared by a loud noise coming from all directions; we look up and see some kind of dark giants with very slender and large limbs, a very flat body and a square head with some kind of antenna or something sticking out at the top of their head (almost like a square building with an antenna).\r  \n\r  \nThere were a lot of those things, so we decided to run as fast as we could to a place with more trees in hopes that they couldn't see us anymore, but after some minutes of running, we encountered a simple house, which was in the middle of a decently-large portion of grass with no trees surrounding it. We ran towards it to get away from the dark giants looming in the forest, and surprisingly, we got in the house with no complications...\r  \n\r  \nInside, a couple of old ladies told us that they welcomed us, and that they were sorry for all we went through, apparently they had some kind of magic wand / rod / stick which made wonders for them and it controlled everything in the forest. They told us that they could even create people with the stick and controll them to do their bidding, but unfortunately some had defects and had to be killed. \r  \n\r  \nThe old ladies told us that we were allowed to wander around the house, as long as we wouldn't go too deep in it. I wondered what they meant until I looked back: this simple and small house was suddenly a humongous labyrinth in which all rooms seemed similar, and yet, different from each other.\r  \n\r  \nWe walked through the house for a while and talked about the stick that supposedly controlled everything. We decided to break it, because we thought that these old ladies were doing something that was morally wrong, although right now as I'm typing this I'm still wondering if that was the right thing to do...\r  \n\r  \nWe found ourselves in a room with the stick resting above a silver plate just as we were finished talking, so I went over to it, grabbed it and snapped it in two with my hands. It felt like snapping a twig in a park. Suddenly afterwards, we heard a loud noise coming from outside, and through a window we saw that the giants were starting to collapse and fall, and the house was suddenly filled with the screams of the old ladies.\r  \n\r  \n\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!\" Was all we could hear, along with some screams which we didn't know if were made because of anger, fear, pain or a mixture of all.\r  \n\r  \nA door appeared beside us, and we went through it to get out of the house. It was still cloudy, but the enviroment regained a bit of its colour back now that the giants were falling. We didn't care for it, though, as we only cared for getting out of there as fast as possible.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we thought we were getting closer to the edge of the forest, from where everything had started, my companion looked back and asked me if I remember what the old ladies said. When I asked them about what they meant, they said that the old ladies affirmed that they could control other people to do what they wanted. I nodded, and my companion pointed back in resonse to my answer.\r  \n\r  \nJust as I turned around I screamed, a man I had never seen before was up in my face with a crazed look in his eyes. It was almost as if he wasn't a man anymore, but rather a fierce animal who had lost all trace of humanity.\r  \n\r  \nHe grabbed me by my shirt with one hand and pulled out a knife with the other. Just as he was stabbing me I woke up, sweating lightly and my legs shaking even though I wasn't standing.\r  \n\r  \nThis happened just today... What does this mean? Did I get suggested by something?"

My boyfriend is there with me and we are trying to find privacy to have sex. We find a room that is like a shed, there is steam\nComing from a nearby hose in the wall and gravel on the ground. We begin kissing and the gravel or broken glass gets in my mouth. I try to pick it out - I want to give my boyfriend head but the gravel or broken glass is in my mouth. It occurs to me that the air or the entire site is probably toxic - due to its nature of being an old industrial site. \n\nNext scene - it is bedtime and my boyfriend is putting my son to bed (common in my waking life).\nMy son won‚Äôt sleep, I open a floor level window while holding him. Outside the window, there is a row of evening spaces faves with a small flower in each. Someone is parked in front of the window with two small children sitting on the side walk. I reach to open the window and it knocks the small vase and the water spills on the sidewalk wetting the children. They begin to cry. I call for someone to bring towels and for help. My son slowly slips from my arms through the open window and bumps the back of his head - it‚Äôs a very small fall maybe 3 inches. \n\nI am concerned, and carry him back to the bed - he seems asleep but I am worried about a brain bleed from the bump. My mom and aunt are there - I consult with them. They say he is fine but I can see his eyes flickering as if he is about to convulse. His face begins changing and I know he is not well.

When he charges at me I pick him up from his arm and set him down on furniture. This happens several\nTime. Someone nearby lifts a large piece of wood or a wooden toy to hit him and I yell for the person to stop - ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hurt him.‚Äù I call out to those around me - ‚Äúcall 911, please google to see if a bump on the head causes aggressiveness.‚Äù I decide to try and corral him by playing a game and telling Conor he is a monster I need to catch. It seems to focus his energy on me - it feels dark and evil. I finally grab him and he becomes an empty box in my hands - like a flattened happy meal box. I wake up screaming, ‚ÄúI have the monster.‚Äù\n\nObservation - writing this  dream down causes me sob \nFeelings upon waking - terror, grief,\nConfusion and helplessness because no one would help me in my dream\n\nEvents leading up - three days before fought with my BFF bc she has been gossiping about me and I felt unwelcome at her house during a visit. Night before dream - boyfriend upset with me over what I perceive to be a minor issue."

And at some point I had him pinned down by the neck, and I though \"I could kill him and end this all now.\" But I couldn't do it, so I let him go.\n\nThe thing is, he wasn't the serpent he is in depictions. He was an enormous blue, red, yellow, and orange bird, with a long neck like a flamingo, but a huge body, like bigger than any person. His body was also like a vulture shape, and he had enormous yellow talons.\n\nHe wasn't trying to kill or eat anybody, but just attacking people, almost like he saw the public pool as his territory.\n\nIf it means anything, I myself am half Mexican, with roots in Chihuahua, Durango, and Jalisco.

I asked my mom why she changed the stairs and she was like the wall cracked and it‚Äôs annoying when it rains. Then I go down and look to the lobby from the kitchen (that‚Äôs not how my house looks like in real life) I see the entire floor done in glossy wood flooring. Then I go out to see that my mom also has adjusted the garage which is now green and she has turned it around and the support bars of it is on the right side blocking the way. Where in real life it was on the left close to a wall and I ask my mom why she did it and it‚Äôs ruining space, she said yea should change that. The garage had 4 support bars all green and rounded giving support to the roof only from the right side. The roof was curved and I saw green colour metal leaves decoration hanging from arch of the roof of the garage. \n\nI saw the dream around 8am.\nThank you any help in understanding this is very appreciated."

Which number brings luck when playing lottery - lottery?** \n\nYou also know, with thousands of different dreams, with the dream of being pregnant being considered the most common. To better understand this dream, let Mu88 give a detailed answer in the specific article below.\r  \n\r  \n**How to interpret dreams of being pregnant?**\r  \nDreaming of pregnancy is a fairly common phenomenon and can be caused by many different reasons. Here are some common interpretations for this paranormal dream:\r  \n\r  \n**Delusions:** A common cause of pregnancy dreams is delusions. In dreams, we can imagine situations, landscapes, and events without reality. Therefore, the dream of being pregnant may just be an illusion that we create in our imagination.\r  \n\r  \n**Influence from reality:** Another possible cause is the influence of reality. If in our daily life we ‚Äã‚Äãare thinking or worrying about getting pregnant or preparing to get pregnant, then the pregnancy dream could be just a reflection of those thoughts.\r  \n\r  \n**Emotions:** Pregnancy dreams can also be a reflection of different emotions we are experiencing, like happiness, anxiety, or stress. Sometimes dreams can also indicate our desires, hopes or fears.\r  \n\r  \n\rIn summary, dreaming of pregnancy can be due to many different causes and there is not a single explanation for all cases. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon in the dream and has no effect on reality.\r  \n\r  \n**What does it mean to dream about being pregnant?**  \nThere is no one specific and common meaning for all pregnancy dreams. Each dream has its own message and meaning, which depends on many factors such as emotional state, the situation in the dream, memories and personal experiences of each person. Here are some meanings of dreams about good and bad things in your life:  \n**Dreaming about being pregnant**  \nDreaming of being pregnant is a very happy and joyful thing for women who are expecting children. However, this creates confusion for women planning without children or husbands. The dream that you are pregnant is usually a good omen, a happy and extremely lucky thing for women who are expecting children. In the coming days, your family life will be favorable and peaceful, because life is often full of luck and happiness.  \n**Dreaming that someone else is pregnant**  \nTo dream that an acquaintance is pregnant is the message that this dream wants to send to you that is to always be happy and live sincerely. Your relationship with your pregnant dream girlfriend is still very good, close, and close. Please try to save it.  \nSee more: [https://mu88.watch/mo-co-bau/](https://mu88.watch/mo-co-bau/)"

(In waking life, I've been out on my own for about a decade and my mom and I get along) Anyway, I left the house and went to a park. Apparently it was sometime shortly after my PhD graduation. I saw some of my classmates at the park.\n\nEveryone was gathered there for a miraculous event. Little balls rained down from the sky. They felt like pebbles when they hit me, but I realized they were very tiny barn owls. As soon as they reached the ground, they grew to full size and flew away. There were so many barn owls everywhere. It looked almost like the end of the world. I remember someone saying they were glad they were owls and not vultures.\n\nI also remember driving a luxury SUV and a few of the \"pebbles\" got in the car as I was getting out to walk in the park. When I came back to the car, there were three full-sized barn owls in the car. I opened the passenger door and they flew off the edge of a cliff. They flew with such force... their wings generated so much wind. Only then did it seem like I could finally be free and move out of my mom's house. What on earth does this mean?\n\nEdit: It was also daytime in the dream. Barn owls are usually nocturnal, so not sure if that's significant."

But the context is different than the wholesome videos I watch. \n\nIn the first dream, I was being chased by two black bears around a playground.

The teacher was saying something and I remember giggling with a girl next to me about something. The teacher told me to please be quiet and said something else rude. I remember myself whispering to the girl next to me saying \"This bitch crazy.\" The teacher got furious and started yelling. I denied I said that to her. Then she threated to kill me and sexual assault me. I ran out the classroom and throughtout the whole dream, I was running from the teacher throughout the entire school.

    "body": "The first part of my dream I remember getting into this elevator with two other girls. As the door closed, we began to fall very fast. At first we thought the whole elevator was falling and we‚Äôd soon hit the bottom. We then realized that the top of of the elevator wasn‚Äôt moving at all. The bottom of the elevator had been a false bottom and we manage to grip on either side of the ‚Äúelevator walls‚Äù. We first tried climbing up but decided it‚Äôd be easier to climb down as long as we did not fall. It seemed to have gone on forever but when we reached the bottom, there was some sort of ramp. This was sort of mind boggling, because surely that fall would‚Äôve killed us and we would‚Äôve slid out at the bottom. We slowly slid out and found ourselves in some sort of factory. There were conveyor belts with packing boxes -just regular old cardboard boxes. \n\nI don‚Äôt remember much more, but the next part of the dream, we were stationed outside moving these large tubs - not the same as the packing boxes from before. There was a large building with two white folding tables and several large trucks surrounding the area. However there were a lot more women here and they are all quite young. There was an elder women yelling and ordering us to put the boxes under and on these tables, and to make sure they are sealed tightly before doing so. There was one with the top sitting on it with one corner of it being uncovered. A girl close by tripped into it and much faster than me and the other girls, she managed to grab onto the sides. I reached in to help pull her out. The lady began to yell and ask who left the box unsealed. A girl sepped forward to explain it was already unsealed and she was unsure of what to do. As the woman began to drag this girl away, I realized that this is very similar to what happened with the elevator, and I assumed all of these tubs contain endless holes, but don‚Äôt understand how. \n\nThe next part of the dream is a strange series of images and happenstances‚Ä¶ The one that sticks out to me the most is the image of a never ending staircase. I believe I have seen this illusion somewhere before, where someone seems to be running up a staircase that always leads back to the same place. But when the perspective is changed, the illusion breaks. I‚Äôve seen it in dreams before, and when I realize it the illusion breaks. Ive seen it in many different ways, but it seems like I see it all at once. One way is that u see the separation of the stairs, from beginning to end, sort of like a 3d model. Another way is as if I‚Äôm looking over the staircase into an abyss. The last way I watch as the person running on the stairs fall to their death‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt quite put these visuals into a specific place in my dream. They either occur before during or after the part I‚Äôm about to explain.\nThe next part of the dream, I am shackled to all the other women and we are walking up these stairs -not the same stairs I see in the visuals- I look up and see tattered wall paper and old portraits on the walls. The stairs have patterned carpet, and some of the flowers on the carpet have a shimmer to them. There are multiple staircases covered in these women, and the ceiling seems to be miles away. There are large men with face coverings guiding the women and belittling them.\n\nAt some point I have escaped these shackles and I‚Äôm running through these halls like I‚Äôm on a mission. I can see other people searching for me as I cause chaos throughout this mansion. I‚Äôm not sure what all I was doing to anger the people ‚Äúin charge‚Äù but the older woman is ordering the men previously mentioned to find me and sedate me. I realized that I can peel the wall back and sort of phase through to different rooms. When I do this it‚Äôs sort of wrapping myself into the wall like a blanket. This goes on forever and I can‚Äôt really explain all of the events that take place, but basically I‚Äôm traveling through the walls and I‚Äôm somewhat omniscient at this point. While running through a hallway, I run into a young man, he is much smaller than me he men previously mentioned. I realize I can take him with me when I go into the walls. As we phase in and out of the walls he gives me more information about what‚Äôs going on. We search the mansion to find more people who can be saved. However, I phase through a wall, and he does not come through with me. \n\nNow I gotta explain a reoccurring thing in my dreams to explain the last portion of this dream. This always occurs in different dreams, they never start the same. Something that is always the same though, is I‚Äôll walk into a room, and when I exit the room I‚Äôve entered what seems to be a completely different realm. I sort of glide across the floor here, and even float higher at times. This place is like a dark mysterious building but I can‚Äôt fully explain what it looks like. I can vividly see it in my mind, but it‚Äôs really weird. It‚Äôs sort of a collection of corridors, almost like a maze. The first time I had this happen I could hear a lot of voices telling me where to go and what to do, but the voices were conflicting with one another in what they were saying. The first time it took forever, but I end up at this ‚Äúwall‚Äù. This wall is a collection of colors and red beams. The colors are more like static, and the red beams bounce both back and forth and up and down. It is a very large wall, and I can‚Äôt decided if it‚Äôs safe to go through. I eventually decide there is nowhere else to go. I float upwards and through the wall, and once again everything has shifted. I‚Äôm sort of out of control in which way my body floats, and there are images and colors flying all around me. I‚Äôve had this happen in many dreams, but they seem to get closer and closer. The first reoccurrence was months after the first occurrence, and now I‚Äôve had it happen back to back. The first time it happened it took me forever to find this ‚Äúwall‚Äù and each time it seems to get easier and easier, like I just know where to go. In the dream I explained above, I immediately arrived at this ‚Äúwall‚Äù and went straight in. All the chaos started like normal, but I felt a sense of peace and maybe even control over this space."

    "body": "Let's start by saying I'm not a strong believer that dreams have always meaningful messages behind them so I'm not scared about what I'm going to share here, it's just interesting and kinda curious.\n\nWhen I was little I used to have this nightmare all the time. I used to sleep in the \"big bed\" with her until I was I guess like 5 or 6 years old. The nightmare was always like this: in my sleep, I woke up for something, I don't know I needed to drink or go to the bathroom, and I looked beside me to see my mother sleeping on her side giving me her back. So I got out of bed, did my things and went to the kitchen, where I would find my mother doing something like cooking and be like \"Oh you woke up\", leaving me with the question of who actually was sleeping beside me in the bed.\n\nI remember doing this dream all the time and be engulfed in a sense of complete dread and despair.\n\nNow I'm 30 years old and I'm having another recurring nightmare regarding my mother for the last couple of weeks. I find this peculiar because it's the second instance in my entire life in which I explicitly remember having the same nightmare more than once, and also so close to the first time, and this one is also about my mother (which, for context, is still alive and totally fine).\n\nI dream that we have a terrible fight, like screaming and berating one another in terrible ways, and then she dies. Not only she dies, she has an actual ictus right between my arms, like it's activated by her rage or her screaming. The dream is extremely brutal and graphic: I don't know how an ictus actually works, but her face basically melts in front of me, like half of it, while she screams something along the line \"Oh God I'm dying, I'm dying\". \n\nIt kinda impressed me. My mother's fine and while we don't agree all the time we're in a totally normal mother-son relationship and absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in the last few weeks or months. I'm also surprised that the only two recurring nightmare I've had in my life are 100% about her, but I guess that's pretty normal too I mean it's my mother."

They took off ahead of me first. I remember thinking \"I don't know how to fly a plane\", but did it anyway. I moved a switch to full speed and pulled back on the joystick when I approached the end of the runway. The plane lifted successfully, but then I could see that I was going faster than my friend. I looked down to the controls to slow the plane. When I looked up, I was going through some clouds, and I was on a collision course with a commercial airplane (it looked like a united airlines plane and I could see the outline of a persone inside). I froze for a moment the pulled up at the last second. I started to lose control of the plane, flying upside down, doing barrel rolls etc. Through the clouds. I successfully made an emergency landing on a city street. The street was empty, but it seemed like a large city. I then tried to use the street as a runway... I think I was successful taking off...

She wanted me to write to the council, letting them know that her and her disabled son are doing OK. It was horrible because I kept making mistakes, my hand writing was scruffy and I had to keep staring again. Also my Nan kept wanting me to add more to the letter, so it felt as though as soon as I had my letter in logical order, more bits of information were missing and I had to start again. I eventually finished the letter but then I realised that it was written on a blank page of a magazine, you could clearly see that the back of it looked as though it was ripped out of a magazine and I thought it looked really unprofessional but it had to do. What could this mean regarding my life? I have been struggling to find a hobby that I love but I soon get sick of it and everything feels dull lately. Could this be linked?

    "body": "What does the dream of seeing fish mean?\r  \nAccording to psychologists, a dream about fish is a harbinger of promotion and your understanding will be expanded and raised to a new level. Moreover, the dream foretells wealth, fame and happiness that is knocking on your door. Dreaming of fish predicts that you will inherit a huge fortune from your family. It is expected that with this money you do not have to do anything, you can live comfortably until the end of your life. However, the dream interpretation advises you to try to build your career because gambling will have a mountain of gold.\r  \n\r  \nThe meaning lies in the dream of seeing carp\r  \nTo dream of a fish is a good omen, fortune and prosperity will come to you in the near future. However, if you dream that a golden carp is eaten by a crocodile, it is a harbinger of trouble. It is best during this period to limit going out and be wary of strangers. When someone you're not familiar with taking leave will help you, and you can best solve the problem on your own by refusing to accept that help.\n\n\r\r  \nDreaming of dead fish  \nIt is a bad omen, a sign of the end of a relationship, things that should not be kept should be given up. Not only that, but this dream also helps you to put your past behind and move towards a better future. Meanwhile, if you see a bunch of processed fish and have a bad smell, this will indicate that you need to go through a difficult and hard time for yourself.  \nDreaming of a mermaid  \nThis is a good omen of love, you will meet your soul mate, the two are very compatible so a marriage will take place in the near future. In some cases, if the mermaid comes close to you and sings, it is a sign that your work is extremely favorable and business is thriving.  \nDreaming that I was eating fish  \nThis foretells you will be favorable, your career development opportunities are great. Continue to be confident in your ability, seize the opportunity well, you will surely succeed in the not too distant future. Not only that, this dream is also a symbol of your spirituality, health and life. Specifically, if you dreamed of carp eating meat, congratulations, good luck has come to you.  \n**&gt;&gt;&gt;See more:** [**https://mu88.watch/mo-thay-ca/**](https://mu88.watch/mo-thay-ca/)"

The church was mostly empty but in a way it felt like a funeral.\n\nMy mom was angry or upset with him, my brother got angry and left. Next dream I remember a man that I only knew for a few months in the dream and was dating. We really loved eachother and he looked like the actor Paul Mescal, idk how he died. I remember we were playing a VR game. The dream takes me back to me sitting in a different room in the church/chapel mourning him. \n\nBut I see a letter blowing throughout the church and it's from him saying even though our love was short, he loved me and wanted me to tell the church something. He was a part of the church as a member apparently. I write a letter to the church saying that I loved him the most out of everyone I've ever known even if we barely knew each other. Felt like a past life love, but it was in today's time. I woke up feeling sad as if I lost someone I loved because it felt real."

    "body": "*scene*\n\nI pull up to a parking lot at a park, having just spent the day, apparently my day off, playing basketball, skateboarding, and generally filling my day with things I enjoy. It's about 4:30 - 5:00 pm outside, and I proceeded to get out of my car and go for a walk in the park while sparking a joint.\n\nAs I get out, there is a mid 30's, brown haired, somewhat chubby, hippy dressed, red satchel wearing gentleman in a second, dirt parking lot in front of me, playing his guitar, singing, and dancing with some pretty decent talent. I spark my joint and watch, standing there, transfixed by his happiness. As I puff on my joint and head out for my walk, he approaches me.\n\n\"Awesome bro!\" I tell him, with a miniature applause. \"I really enjoyed your performance!\" I still have about a third of the joint left, so I hand it to him with the classic stoner 'Ere!, and ask him about himself.\n\nImmediately, it becomes apparent that he wasn't really all there. His singing did not transfer to being able to formulate real speech, and he definitely seemed nonverbal. I try to talk to him a while, telling him about my day, that I also play guitar and sing, and some other things, but eventually I give up and go on my walk. The walk is a fast forward in dream time, but I remember watching the sun start to descend.\n\nWhen I get back to the parking lot, I see him on the sidewalk of the dirt lot, rocking and fiddling and stimming in a mad, autistic sort of way. Realizing he is homeless, I want to help him. When I approach and ask him his name, and if I could get him some food or anything, he is just completely unaware of the world around him. I try for a bit to get his attention, but when I notice he still has the joint as I had handed it to him, unsmoked and intact, I give up and back away.\n\nAs I start my car, I notice his red satchel in the parking spot next to me, underneath the tire of another vehicle. I get out, pick it up and dust it off. Heading over to return it to him, I am already getting emotional at the sad sight of this man.\n\n\"Hey buddy,\" I say as I approach. \"You dropped your bag!\" I squat in front of him and try to hand it back, but he still doesn't notice me. Try as I might to break him of his trance, he just isn't in this world at the time. \"I'm just going to set it down here next to you, okay? Don't forget it again! I'm sure it's important.\"\n\nAt this point night has fallen, and the moon is bright. I start to turn away before standing up, and as soon as my eyes are off of him I am startled to feel his hand snatch my wrist. I turn back in shock, and he is looking at me with a piercing gaze, tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Thank you.\" He says.\n\nI immediately start to cry. Sobbing, I reach into my pocket saying, \"Can I please show you something?\" He nods, and as I pull out my phone to show him a picture of my real life 6 week old baby daughter, as I look at the phones screen...\n\n*scene*\n\nI wake up. With actual tears in my eyes, and still in the swings of a 1¬∞-1.5¬∞ fever.\n\nUpon waking, I definitely felt frustrated that I woke up before showing him the picture. It felt really important for some reason. I've been crying on and off since this dream, I honestly don't remember the last time I was this emotional for this long, if ever.\n\nI have an instinctual interpretation of this, but I want to hear what other people say without influencing your interpretation.\n\nThanks for reading."

If this helps, I am a newer pagan who has been searching for a deity. \n\nIn the dream, I remember standing in an environment with lots of sand. It could have been a desert, but I'm not 100% sure. The only thing I remember was a goddess swooping down with a griffin. I remember her name being a 3-letter Egyptian name that started with the letter J. It was pronounced jay, as in blue jay, but a google search did not reveal any deities like this. Her having a griffin really stood out to me. I think we rode into battle together, but I can't remember.\n\nAny style of interpretation is fine with me."

    "body": "Disclosure: this one describes graphic violence towards animals. \n\nThere‚Äôs a stray female white cat that I‚Äôm trying to kill. No matter how hard I try, she doesn‚Äôt die. I attempt to choke it and drop it from the top of a high balcony, but the cat just lands on it‚Äôs feet and regains consciousness. I feel frustrated because I want it to be a clean death, but the animal just keeps pushing through, stretching out the gruesome process. I feel guilty and shameful, but keep trying over and over until I just let it be. \n\nMultiple animals appear at dawn and get in between my way with the white cat, mostly other strays that come looking for food. The cat is paralyzed, but still alive. I just want it to die peacefully ffs. But then two goats show up and a voice (I believe it was the goat) asks me what I consume from it. I reply, ‚Äúmeat, milk, cheese‚Ä¶ yogurt?‚Äù and they invite me to try a cup of their blood. So I make an incision right into the goat‚Äôs neck and harvest the hot blood. I drink it fast and surprisingly hot blood doesn‚Äôt taste like anything. I wake up."

    "body": "So I had this weird dream, I remember feeling as though it was a nightmare. I started getting memories of the dream in the afternoon and kept remembering more. It was vivid to where I remember this red/bloody moon that was getting bigger and a sense of fear, I also remembered that I could feel the world was about to end, the worst sense of doom. Then I can‚Äôt remember exactly but some kind of explosion or maybe the sun hit the earth. I just remember the feelings were so real and terrible but the only talking/interaction was the very end where I had this intense feeling that I just had to get the words ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù out of my mouth right before it was over/the world ends. I was needing to tell my kids, they are 3 and almost 5. I just cant shake the intense feeling at the end and it almost ended with relief, SO bizarre. \n\nI will add that my mom and sister and I are very open about our dreams since I was young. I have had dreams about family members passing before someone actually passes. I know it sounds crazy, but I am completely being  honest. My mom actually takes all of my vivid dreams serious. I am the youngest of 5, I have 3 brothers and a sister.\n\nThe last time I had a very emotional feeling dream was about my brother. I had dreamt that I was in this courtyard with pillars everywhere, kids waking around too. I was trying to get to my bother, I knew something was wrong but I didn‚Äôt know what. The emotion and feelings of dread and fear were so intense I woke up and started crying which I‚Äôve never done. I was just following him trying to get to him but he was just always right out of reach. Nothing bad happened in my dream but the bad feeling only intensified. I‚Äôll never forget this feeling, it felt like my soul was being ripped out of me.\n\nA week after this dream, my brother (same from my dream) almost died from a bowel perforation and the radiologist missed it TWICE. I‚Äôm a nurse, but I saw him in the hospital for the two days and the exact feelings from the dream I had in real life. I was actually physically feeling sick and so scared that this was actually happening. I had to tell the nurse that he was not ok and eventually was able to get a doctor in the room on the 3rd day. They called a rapid response immediately when the doc saw how terrible he looked; dusky. Within 2 hours he was in emergency surgery. I literally saved him, he was so close to the end it was unreal. They never figured out why or what caused this random perforation and he has no history. \n\nI have not been the same since this happened last March. I actually finally went for Cognitive processing therapy and realized I had ptsd from it all and thankfully doing much better.\nI just wanted to give a background on my dream history because I have had a hard time processing my dreams after it happening to my brother.\n\nFor once, nothing stressful or crazy is happening in my life. I have autoimmune disease that has been affecting my muscles and heart rate more, I wondered if it‚Äôs maybe anxiety that something is going to happen to me?"

I entered just to realize I was inside the old gym I used to go when I was a kid, which had a swimming pool that I learnt to swim in.\n\nI looked back at my dad just to find out he was suddenly in his swimming outfit, and before I could ask \"when did you change?\" he immediately dived into the swimming pool (which he doesn't know how to do irl) and swam away doing butterfly (which he can't do irl neither)\n\nIdk why I assumed he would never come back and I kept walking into the other parts of the building. I found a room where tons of people where waiting sitting (god knows why). I saw in the crowd a very handsome blonde dude with a giant beard, and I started approaching him to ask him for his instagram. He smiled at me and we started talking. I take out my phone to give him my number and when I look back at him, it turns out im talking to a totally different guy, a small, bald dude with red eyes and a creepy smile. I give him my number still, thinking I might have messed up and talked to the wrong person, but when he's about to take it I spring from my sit and start running for my life and that's where I wake up.\n\nWhat does it mean??

Maybe someone can help me out.\n\nSo what I remembered I was hanging out on the home Street of my life (3-19y). At the end of the Street there is a concrete water building and on next to it a farm field. I was hanging out at the field with 3 of my closest friends as I felt suddenly that the farm was mine. And as I decided I was a farmer carrots start popping up. I then found my self in a pile of carrots on the side of the field as my friends deminingly with a humoristic touch called me \"carrot\" which was a nick name i got during a sportcamp when I was 11 which I didnt really like or felt associated with.\nThen as we walked back to my house on the Street we passed the water building where 2 distant friends of mine were I assumed playing as we used to play alot as kids on the building.\nOne of these friends I respect alot becuase of his charachter and way of life. The other one I like but I have some suspicious doubt and distrust towards his attitude.  Anyways they came with us to my home and as we enter the shoeroom this guy without saying a single word just wals inside and starts bouncing a dirty football all over the clean room. I get upset and confronts him by grabbig his shoulder and look him in his eyes. And as I do he turns into a child like face which could as likly been mine with eyes and pupils lsrge and black like and I immedietly associated it with massive benzo high. I figure thats where people end up when taking too much benzo just ignoring alot of what we learnt to become adults and return to the state when we were ignorant children and got loved for our faults anyway. As I awwed in this realization my mum appeared behind me telling me I was wrong to confront the child like this and she treated this kid more like a puppy. \n\nAnyways what should I take with me from this session?"

The room wasn't completely dark, it was partially lit by one of those old low quality yellow basement lights. In this room were three distinct things, a concrete beam in the middle of it, the lower half of a plastic bottle to catch water droplets that were dripping from the ceiling that was pretty low and one of those old wooden chairs facing the beam. For some reason I can't explain, I felt this otherwordly sense of dread and terror, I was almost having a panic attack, I felt my heart racing, was developing tunnel vision, my throat drying up and my eyes popping out of my head just looking at this room. The rest of the dream i do not remember, just this part. I've been thinking about this dream the whole day and I still do not understand why I felt this primal level of terror just looking at this room, I don't know why but I'm positive that it was supernatural."

    "body": "**Some background:** He was a poor communicator unless we were in person and would constantly let me down, \"forget\" or go back on promises made. It was clear he didn't care or couldn't be bothered with me if i got too much for him i guess. I'd just be ignored until i waited long enough for him to reply or i essentially,  blew up his phone. which was usually what happened. I'd vent my frustrations, try to distance, ghost him even but he would act hurt by those actions and want me to \"come back\" to the friendship but never compromised on what i asked of him. Once he moved away, he didn't care about maintaining the friendship. It was rough but i eventually and finally removed him and stuck to it. With that out of the way let's get to the dreams...\n\nI've had about 3 vivid dreams about him. To preface, I don't remember my dreams. Ever. (Aka i dont dream) but whenever i wake up from a full rest and go back to sleep to catch some extra Zzz's, thats when i get the weirdest dreams like being young again with all my elementary class mates going through this maze like house while everyone is roasting/bullying me or trying to fight someone but my arms are like wet noodles no matter how hard i swing. I try to run away but im slower than a snail despite going full speed.\n\nWith him, the dreams were EXTREMELY WHOLESOME (he, irl is an antisocial loner who ill look you dead in the eye and walk away mid conversation if he doesn't know you and doesn't want to talk). The first one was last year so the memory has faded but the second one happened  a little over a month ago. I was in Laos and strangely i was there with the side of my family i dont like. It was a good time. Everyone was having fun on the beach, by the water etc. I went in to some sort of beach restaurant and i saw him from the corner of my eye but wasn't sure if he saw me, I avoided him and went back to my family. I see him walk by while im with them but this time we make eye contact. I don't acknowledge i just kind of act like i looked past him. I go back to the place where i first saw him (i think for food, idk its a dream lol) and he sees me again, eye contact again, but this time i smile but still look away. Next thing i know he's approaching me and he is in full uniform (Air force vet but was wearing a Marine uniform in my dream. Idk why) in front of me catching up with me and we end up just talking and walking along the beach and i eventually go my separate ways back to my family and then i wake up.\n\nThe reason i think im in Laos or even Vietnam at this time is because before i stopped talking to him, he was vacationing in one of these places which I also plan to go to for my own trip when im older. But I don't understand why i was having a good time with people I personally cutted out of my life.\n\nThe second dream i had today. Same situation of falling asleep again. I was with friends in this dream and we were having a good time (outside settingni believe. We were on a bench) then he appears and again, same old catching up but he's completely changed in physical appearance this time. He had outrageous ink and piercings and facial implants, grew his hair out longer than before had a whole different style too. It surprisingly didn't turn me away, i still found him easy on the eyes in the face. In this dream he was a lot more openly affectionate: hugs, sitting close, forehead kisses and just seeming like he changed but it was a maaaajor 180. All of these gestures I did not reciprocate or acknowledge. I just smiled and continue whatever i was doing.\n\nI guess what i want to know is, why am I having better-than-reality dreams about someone who I have long since cut off and want nothing to do with anymore? I genuinely dont miss him. He made me feel shitty about myself without even trying. And I went quite a long time (little over 3 months) without a thought or care or regard in the world about him.

And yet my dreams make me feel like there's such a high possibility of us running in to each other again (there's not, i promise) if we do i will not act like everything is fine like i did last time.

    "body": "My mom passed away in February this year and since her passing nightmares of her have become more prominent. When she was alive I had nightmares of her hurting my younger sister. The nightmares got so bad that I would wake up and be furious with her, and myself for not stopping her. In those nightmares something was always preventing me from getting to my little sister, but I could hear her screaming out of pain. Last night I had another nightmare about her banging on the front door of the house we grew up in and her yelling at my younger sister. My sister opened the door for her and the first thing that I did was try and run, but I became a bit more conscious and instead of running I walked out of the room and step in front of my sister so that she couldn't hurt her. I remember my sister being scared but for once she wasn't screaming out of pain, she just looked at me and that was it. I just want to know why I keep having nightmares about my mom. I've been having them since I was 6. I am 20 now."

I don't remember the exact chronology of my dream but parts of it, which I will try to restitute :\n ‚Ä¢I remember being inside a sort of narrow towel entirely made up of stairs. I was surrounded by a thick crowd of persons, and most of them climbed up, but for some reason, I decided to follow two women who were climbing down. I extirpated myself of the ascending group and walked behind the two women. They were tidyly dressed, and I had a sudden spike of feeling powerful and special walking in the steps of these two non-conforming and supposedly clever and upper-classed ladies. I instantly visualized in my mind's eye myself wearing the same clothes as theirs and imitating their assertive attitude, which made me feel superior. But as we were progressing down, the stairs got completely tangled. But when I say tangled, I really mean it. Some parts of it even were more scale-looking, it was a mess. One woman disappeared, and the other tried not to fall. Her look turned less classy, and I could finally see her face. She had an exagerated expression of fear, and seemed way more ordinary than I had thought earlier. Concerning me, I was afraid of losing control and falling, everything around me was flimsy and cracked.\n ‚Ä¢Later in the dream, I was back home. I saw my cat and advanced towards her, but I felt something different about her. When I approached her, I coud remove her skin and fur. My real cat smelt her, shocked, and I didn't know how to react. I was numb.\n\nWhat could it mean ??"

    "body": "About a month ago, I had a very strange and memorable dream about someone I‚Äôve only ever seen a few times in an old photograph, about 110 years old. The person in question, for whatever reason, did have a vague sort of familiarity to them, but I have not been able to place my finger on a relation to any person I‚Äôve met in my waking life. A few weeks after seeing the photo, I had pretty much not thought about it much at all, until I went to sleep on a Friday night, and had this dream. In the dream, I appeared on a dirt path running from left to right, with an old house directly in front of me. Everything in the dream was in black and white. The girl from the photo was standing in the doorway, and behind her, inside the house, was pure pitch blackness. When we saw each other, there was a moment of extreme elation between both of us, and we met each other on the porch of this house and hugged, both very happy to see each other. Like two old friends meeting after many years. The dream then skipped to what I thought was the inside of this house, sitting on an old style couch. We were sitting side by side, looking rigidly straight ahead. We never turned to look at each other, but I could see her also looking straight ahead in my peripheral vision. Ahead of me, I could see only a sparse wooden plank floor stretching on for about 15 feet, and then it faded to just darkness. I could not see the end of the room. For whatever reason, I became aware that we were unable to speak to each other, but we could sort of feel each others emotions, and we were surrounded by the most warm happy feeling, like just so happy to even exist next to each other. And then, she simply leaned over, and pushed her left cheek against my right cheek, and it was extremely surprising to me in the dream. I could feel every detail of her face. It was the most real and detailed physical sensation I‚Äôve ever had in a dream. She then simply pulled away without a word, and we continued to stare straight on into this darkness. The dream then skipped to us in a standing position, her directly in front of me with her back to me, and me with my hands on both of her shoulders from behind, still just looking straight ahead. I made note of how small and fragile her frame felt, too small for her, and it concerned me for a moment. She was shorter than me, coming up to about the bottom of my chin, and I could just make out the top and back of her head as we both looked forward. It then felt like she took me to a doorway, still in the same position as before, except now we were looking into a small ornate mirror on the wall inside this room. And we just stood there, staring at ourselves in this mirror, still surrounded by that same incredible warm feeling from before. She wore the slightest smirk on her face as we looked into the mirror, and I noted to myself that she was really pretty. And then it was over."

At first I thought it was the sun shining off of black fur, but it was actually a deep blue color which I found very strange.\n\nAnyway, she followed me throughout this small unknown town and I was a little nervous. She was a *very* large cat after all. When I turned to see where she was, she was right at my heels. She sat down, looked up at me with kindness in her eyes, and jumped! She jumped up into my arms. She let me hold her like you would a child on your hip.\n\nThe purring...oh, that deep peaceful purr that emanated from her. I felt that vibration on my chest and shoulder. It felt nice. I honestly was a little bummed that I woke up. I carried that cat through this town for a while.\n\nI stopped at a gas station, apparently my landlord owned it. I told the man that I was going to drop off my rent check but actually had forgotten it. He was okay with it, but was *very* nervous about my new friend, haha. \n\nAny idea what this deep royal blue colored cat means? She was as sweet as pie....she made me feel so comforted and loved. The vibrations of her purrs made me feel so at peace. This dream is definitely a nice change from the parade of nightmares I've had for the last few weeks.

    "body": "Monday, May 22\n\nLast night I had a dream about me, a girl, and time travel\n\nSo it started off with me and my friends at a convention for our school or something. I'm guessing it was for jobs after high-school. Anyway, I was hanging out and I started talking to this girl named Maddison Duley. She was a popular girl at my school. After a little bit of talking, we snuck off to the shipping bay of the building we were in.(the building was kinda like a supermarket) After talking about us and what we like and just getting to know each other better, I leaned in to kiss her and it she was laying on the floor I was over top of her with my eyes facing her chin. She said \"No, we are not kissing upside down, come over here and kiss me normally\". We did and when I opened my eyes, I was back in my chair from a couple hours earlier. After the convention finished, I realized that I had the ability to time travel and I don't know how I got it. I went to my best friend Jesse and I said the following (his mom was taking us home) \"Jesse, so I have the ability to time travel, don't ask how, I don't know. Anyways, I was talking to a girl and I kissed her. I had her, you know? I got a girlfriend! But then I accidentally timetravelled mid kiss and now I'm worried I won't ever get her back!\" \"What do I do?\" Jesse said \"idk man, if you really want this girl then no offense to my mom but screw her and go get her\" to this I said \"thanks bro, I love you\" and ran off to go get her.\n\nI made it in the building and then got arrested by the in building police because of disorderly conduct because apparently I was making a ruckus by running around the building looking for Maddison. As I was sitting in this tiny silverish black cell, I saw two guards outside at a long control panel facing away from the cell sitting down. Outside the cell, there was another inmate named Hunter Bryd sitting at the control panel with the guards. Our outfits were teal btw. Anyways, I had enough and time traveled to get out of this but little did I know I traveled back to a few minutes before I kissed Maddison and this time travel sent me to the timeline where I kissed and disappeared from her. I unknowingly went looking for her and couldn't find her. I decided to go back to my cell and serve my short time there (about 2 hours). I saw that they didn't even know I was gone because the two guards and hunter were watching a movie on a projector. I served my last 10 minutes and walked out. I tore off the prison stuff and it had my normal cloths underneath. As I walked down this white hallway, I saw a senior I knew, Ella. She knew Maddison. I ran to her and asked her if she has seen Maddison. She said to come with her because she was the head of security cameras. As I walked into her room, Maddison came down the hallway crying. At that moment, I realized that I was back in my original timeline. I ran to Maddison and asked her what's wrong. She kept crying. I asked her if she wanted to go to a place more private to talk and she said yes. We walked to Ella's room because I knew Ella didn't mind. When we got in there, we laid on the bed and I tried to talk to her. She pushed me over on my back and tried to straddle me. She asked what I wanted and I said \"I want you to be my girlfriend.\" She seemed upset and confused by this. I assume it was because I didn't explain my sudden disappearance. She ran out crying and I chased after her. \n\nThat is all I remember from this dream."

The train starts to leave, one gets on, the second throws his bag up but quickly the space to jump is too great and he misses it. \n\nSuddenly, I‚Äôm now on the train. In a passenger carriage. The dirty vagrants are next to me, the one who missed saunters in and sits down with his friends. We are moving quickly. We aren‚Äôt going to school, it doesn‚Äôt stop there like I thought it did. That‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll get off at the next stop. The next stop is somewhere unfamiliar to me. It‚Äôs high in mountains. We‚Äôve travelled through tunnels to get there. We pull into the station. It‚Äôs a dead-end, the last stop. I leave the train-station quickly because I feel anxious, I want to walk back to my hometown. \n\nI have to walk down the mountain. It‚Äôs a rocky ravine, it‚Äôs dangerous - like a goat-track and I‚Äôm scared. I have a sandwich with me and I don‚Äôt want to drop it over the side. There‚Äôs all sorts of hazards including slippery plastic on the track. Two 30-40yo women are coming up. They have sneakers on. I don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre better prepared than I am. They tell me that I‚Äôm going the wrong way. If I carry on, it‚Äôs a 3 hour journey to the next town (which is in the wrong direction I want to travel in). \n\nI look around to try and see landmarks. I‚Äôm confused because the landmarks keep changing. Now the ladies have told me where I am, I can orient myself. I‚Äôll have to go back up to the train-station to return to town after all, it‚Äôs the safest option. \n\nSo I‚Äôm climbing back up. All of a sudden there‚Äôs all these grandmas climbing toward the train station. I ask if they can hold my sandwich in their handbag so that I can climb up too. I‚Äôve removed the plastic from the ledge so that everyone can walk smoothly and won‚Äôt slip. The old lady directly behind me grudgingly puts my sandwich in her bag, but she wants to get past me. We take a couple steps before she hands my sandwich back and tells me that I better look after it if I want to get back. \n\nShe pulls out a map (it looks like the marauders map from Harry Potter, it‚Äôs a magic map) and it starts self-drawing to reveal the route the train took through the tunnels and mountains. It‚Äôs not at all the route I thought I was going. Now I‚Äôm going up to the train to catch it back to my hometown to start over. \n\nNote: I lived in two towns, one aged 0-14 and a second 14-18. This setting is the latter. I now (31) live overseas &amp; have for a decade. I was my current-age in this dream."

I honestly dont actually want to work because I feel like it's too early to commit but too late to be wasting time, maybe that's got something to do with this reoccuring dreams. I got my first job at sales on may 15 and that's the first time I dreamt of dying. \n\nMy dream goes like this, I was at my workplace just doing MS stuff then suddenly our store was getting robbed and i got hold at gunpoint. at that point my heart was pumping. i dont know why but i tried stealing the gun away but got shot in the head. my body heats up then i woke up. i dont remember every dreams but im most certain that every day i die in my dream, and each dream i die and wake up with my heart pumping and my body heating up. \n\nThen fast forward to may 27, i got a call from my boss that i am fired, im gonna be honest... i got fired because i have no motivation at work, or working in general so im both happy and relieved that i got fired. because i couldnt quit my job because of the paperwork that has been processed, if i quit then i will have problems with the government of labour or whatever, but if i get fired then i wouldnt have any problems at all. after all that i slept like a log and then it happens again, but this time ive got my dad with me. my dad was shot when i was driving him to his work, i panicked and just drove quickly to a nearest hospital. while carrying my dad to the hospital i looked back and got held at gunpoint, got shot at my legs then shot my ear. at that point i knew i was gonna die so i accepted it and then the final bullet came through my head. ghen everything goes black, i see a timer from 5&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1, then the timer goes zero. i knew i died, but what i felt was different, before my heart races and my body heats up but this time i felt like i am truly dead... then peaceful of darkness for a few seconds then my eyes slowly opens. then i realized i was dreaming and did not actually die, then i fall asleep again... i wasnt sure why but i knew i was dead but i wasnt. it mentally changed me... i dont know anymore"

It was night and there was a howling wind along with bright flashing lights which I can only describe as looking like explosions of plasma or an aurora borealis.

Weird I know but once I turned it back off I saw multiple huge rocks heading towards us.

It was a little dingy in there, and it was very, very shot back; it was a massive room, full of all the same furniture (it all went together very well) and the family was mostly men. And I think the reason why we were there is because I started dating an Italian man with possibility of being the head, or soon to be, of his family‚Äôs mafia.\nMy sister, as old as we are, still likes to try and embarrass me IRL. She told me something along the lines of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt sit down and eat, you‚Äôve already eaten and you at least need to dress nicer‚Äú but a little meaner and snarky. Mind you, I was the one that got us in with this family because of someone‚Äôs interest in me, someone who wants to potentially marry me thus introducing our families together, someone thinks highly of me enough to do this, they think I‚Äôm beautiful and worthy no matter what. \nSo, biting my tongue, I walked away and said nothing, even though I wanted more than anything to verbally lash out at her due to how deeply she hurt my feelings. I went to go find our mother to go sit with and just sit with because she has a tendency of taking my sister side‚Ä¶ So I knew I couldn‚Äôt vent to her about the situation, I just wanted to be around someone I knew and try to calm down. \n\nThe dream transitions.\n\nNow we‚Äôre outside the compound, and my sister wanted to take a carriage, and I suppose I was the only one that was allowed to drive it. She said ‚ÄúI want to go to the Galleria.‚Äù my response to that was, ‚ÄúHow on earth, do you expect us to go to the galleria in a horse-drawn carriage? It‚Äôll take forever!‚Äù Still I thought maybe I can appease her by taking a little short drive. So she told me to just use the white one. It‚Äôs a single person one and it‚Äôs just four of us (two being her small children), so I abide her request and go and try to retrieve the carriage; It was in a little barn above a pond, and once I went to go get it, it was just a re-purposed washer with wheels. üôÑ"

    "body": "\r  \n**What is the dream meaning of not wearing clothes?**\n\nDreaming of being naked has several meanings. All are reflections of the present mind of the dreamer. It could be a problem that has been reported and needs to be fixed, or it could just be a re-enactment of what the dreamer had in mind.\r  \n\r  \nMany people believe that dream interpretation is extremely necessary because it can give you omens about the past, present or future in study, work, health, love, etc.\r  \n\r  \nTo dream that you are naked indicates that you are deliberately running away. This dream also represents being shunned, hated, afraid of being ridiculed by others.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are in a new love and dream of being naked, this dream suggests that you are nervous or afraid to express your thoughts and feelings to that person.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, this is just one of the ways to interpret the dream of seeing yourself without clothes. Because in each dream, the circumstances, details and images appear different. Therefore, in order to know the most specific and accurate omens, we must interpret separately in each specific case.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream interpretation of not wearing clothes good or bad?**\r  \nAccording to experts, dreams involving naked people often reflect things related to all your relationships. Specifically, the dream owner will meet the market in the near future. Therefore, you need to pay more attention to every word, including yourself.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming of walking but not wearing clothes**\r  \nIn your dream, you see yourself walking through a crowd of people naked. What does this undressed dream imply? This dream shows that you are a person who is easily hurt or embarrassed in front of others.\n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;See more:** [**https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/**](https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/)\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being naked in the classroom, at work**\r  \nIf you dreamed that you were naked at work, in class, such a dream indicates that you are not really ready for a certain plan. You feel stressed and confused when making decisions, especially when the attention of many people makes this problem even more serious.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream of not wearing clothes but no one notices**\r  \nIf in your dream appears the image of you naked but no one notices or notices that. This dream shows that your fears are completely unfounded. You yearn for more people to notice you.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being proud of my nudes**\r  \nIf one day you dream that you are naked but completely proud and unashamed, it is a sign that you are a free spirit.

First person perspective, so I was experiencing everything.\n\nI was on a beautiful, endless meadow full of flowers. Nice temperatures, blue sky, no civilization in sight, sun was out, a mild and enjoyable summer day in nature in god knows where. \n\nFor some unknown reason I was running through the meadow, away from an agitated swarm of bees which chased me. Chasing and definitely touching my skin, but not attacking. Not a single sting, but I was still afraid of the bees and kept running, tried to keep my mouth closed to avoid swallowing bees and hoped none would end up in my eyes.\n\nThen I jumped into a small pond with crystal clear water to escape and looked up. From below I could see the swarm on the surface and it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I don't know if the swarm was big or if the bees hovered above the surface but it took a while. I was too afraid of the bees to emerge and started to struggle from lack of air but I still didn't want to dive upwards.\n\nDream ended with me inevitably floating towards the surface, eyes and mouth firmly closed."

(I don't have a twin in real life) Together we were walking down the road to go to college. (I don't go to college) There was a really bad accident at a roundabout we were crossing through, and one of the vehicles actually went up into the air, and landed partially on her. It was like something out of a Final Destination movie. Anyway, she went to the hospital in an ambulance, and while she was in the hospital, she died. The nurse accused me of murdering her, because she was apparently getting better. I left the hospital, crying and went to a restaurant across the street. I was too upset to eat, but my abusive ex wife came over to talk to me. She offered me a ride home, and I hesitantly accepted. Her passenger car door and window were both broken, and I had to stick my arm out the window and hold onto the door from the outside to keep it closed. I end up slicing my arm really bad, and she wouldn't take me to the hospital. She said it was for my own good, because I don't have health insurance. We got into a fight about it and she ended up leaving me in an alley, and while walking home, I passed out.

    "body": "Hi for some background context my dad has been dead since 2010. I was 9 when he passed so I've spent more of my life without him than I did with him, and the rest of my family has/had a much closer relationship to him. I always lived with my mother while he traveled for work and only visited us occasionally. I wasn't even a person, or I didn't feel in control of my actions yet when he passed away (by suicide). The manner of death has caused me to feel a kind of way and re-evaluate all the interactions I remember having with him which tend to skew negative. Like I feel guilty for not wanting to do something because maybe if I did he wouldn't have or I feel angry that he didn't try to see me grow up. Anyway I know that's not my fault but that is easier to say than it is to believe. \n\nI continue to have complicated feelings about it to this day, but basically today is his birthday and in a month will be the 13 year anniversary of his death. This may have stirred things up because I was keeping myself aware of it so that I could text my mom and offer comfort if she needed it. However, I've never had a dream directly about him before now. If anything, it was mentioned in passing or was implied, but I never had physically seen him in my dreams that I can remember. And since its been over a decade we don't really feel impacted by the anniversary unless its like a big one. \n\nNow onto the dream. In the dream I was myself as a child, probably around the age that he died and we were in a house I was unfamiliar with. So in my early childhood, my parents were off and on and in this dream my dad came home with a new girlfriend. She seemed nice enough and really supported him to the point of slightly disliking myself, my sister, and my mom. But this led to us not liking her all that much, so it was suggested that I scare her. I put on some three part black outfit, I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be and hid behind a door. When she opened it, I kinda hissed but I didn't get a reaction. Then I think one of them said they were going to take our cat (or I felt like it was implied that they were going to hurt it - which is not something he would do as a person but mirrors a situation where I thought he had cremated our cat when I was very young) so I was naturally very mad and upset. I grabbed the cat and ran into a bedroom, I did not see my dad for the remainder of the dream nor did he say anything else, but I remember that I suddenly felt the anger, sadness, and disappointment he felt about me and my actions. I started crying unconsolably for several minutes because it felt like he would never forgive me. \n\nThen it was like a hard cut to a school theatre play I was doing tech for (so random but I did do this in middle school). I thought he would come out to at least support me, but when I walked outside to find my parents after it was done, I only saw my mom. I began crying super hard again which is when my mom introduced me to some guy that I don't recognize from my real life. But again I had the feeling that he knew my dad and he was trying to console me by telling me about a similar situation he had been in or something. That's when I got a phone call and woke up, but I just feel super gross and really bad about the dream and would like to understand it. Is it just a manifestation of that scenario that actually happened or something deeper? Also like why now?"

I had bought a very old run down house with old furnishings etc still there, it looked to have been well lived in but completely abandoned with everything still there. It was like a maze too, so many rooms and floors. I was exploring the house and trying to do a bit of tidying up, when in one of the bathrooms I found a bath that was part of the structure, like an old Roman type bath maybe. I turned the water on to try and test it to make sure it actually worked, when water started flowing into the bath a massive bunch of spiders (huge spiders üò≥üò≥) came running out the wall attached to the bath. I freaked out and turned the water off, they ran back into the wall. Left the room and explored more, went into another room and found a large bunch of cats that were mostly feral but they were actually very healthy looking. Some of them were friendly, others were hissing at me, others were distant but curious. First thought was to call SSPCA as a bunch of abandoned cats, wanted them to be rescued and checked over by a vet. Went exploring a bit more and in another room I found a bunch of dogs, all pretty friendly thankfully and looking healthy. Then in another room I found a mixed bunch of cats and dogs with some rabbits in the mix, all very friendly and coexisting together peacefully and looking healthy.

When I woke up, I did not know if it actually occurred or was just a dream. At one point during the dream I became self aware that I was dreaming and I wanted it to keep going as long as possible. However I had no control over what was happening in the dream, everything kept going and I just went along with it. So in this dream, I was myself as I am (20f) and I was the girlfriend of a famous singer (20m). I wont say who he is because none of you will know who he is and also its not really relevant. Now something about this singer, he‚Äôs the complete opposite of me and when they say opposites attract I used to never believe in that kind of stuff but for some time now I have been attracted to him like if he was a literal magnet. I am completely mesmerized. Because I am fascinated by his personality and lately I have learned a lot about myself even if it‚Äôs just from having on a crush on this guy. In the dream, it was the night of his concert, and I felt amazing. Let me tell you something about myself: I am very shy, serious, not the type to even enjoy a concert, but here in my dream I was having the time of my life! I felt safe and secure despite being in a large crowd. I felt an overwhelming amount of confidence which I have never experienced in real life. Then the singer (my boyfriend in my dream) took me backstage. And basically I just felt completely in love with him and he was obsessed and in love with me as well?!Again, this guy is very different from anyone I have ever felt interest in real life. And it‚Äôs not just because he‚Äôs famous or whatever, it‚Äôs because of his personality: his carefree laidback attitude, his ability to make friends easily, and the way he‚Äôs relaxed and easygoing about life is polar opposite from me. The dream ended when I began to realize I was dreaming. It ended off by him bringing me onto stage with him and introducing me to the crowd as his girlfriend. The crowd went wild and began screaming in excitement. And that‚Äôs the end. So can someone help me understand what this means?! I‚Äôm a girl who just stays at home reading books and never goes out at all, and suddenly I have the most intense realistic dream of my entire life where I am a rockstar‚Äôs girlfriend? Help Lol"

I ran to her room and saw her sitting on the stairs breaking down her baby gate as well as bed rails. I looked over and saw boxes that were packed up. I said \"What are you doing? Are you moving out soon? Or are you just making space?\" she said \"I'm hoping to do both.\" And I woke up after to my phone vibrating. \n\nMe and my ex still live together ATM but we stay in seperate rooms."

I meet with some people i know and through them a meet a guy that works in my building. We start walking back to work and some guys goes running towards where we came from. We keep walking and a guy comes out from across the street with a crazed look and a bloody knife. The guy I‚Äôm with confronts him as I run away. Absolutely sprinting. I get onto the Main Street, a van pulls up, a guy gets out and somehow I escape. \n\nHere I have the opportunity to wake up out of the dream but I don‚Äôt take it. I know it‚Äôs a dream and I want to see where it goes. I am now in my office building bathroom with the guy I was originally with and another person. Outside in the hall we can hear the door open and we know it‚Äôs the guy with the knife. We walks into the bathroom and confronts me. The guy I‚Äôm with again tries to save me and in the process is stabbed and so is the other person. I manage to escape again. \n\nOutside my mom who is not my mom irl is there to pick me up along with 2 sisters who end up being left for some reason. We start driving, I tell her what happened and I call the cops. I ask if anyone‚Äôs reported anything and no one has and I start going into what I remember but it‚Äôs a dream and I can‚Äôt think of all the details. The line cuts and I wake up. What does this mean?!?? Thank you"

    "body": "I was in that vaguely familiar dreamspace with elements of my life, furniture and articles from my past etc. I was sitting on a barstool at a bar my dad built in our basement when I was a kid. A woman enters through a doorway, wearing a teal dress of intricate design and patterns, shiny with inlaid gems of blue, and takes a seat next to me. She holds out her hand and tells me to take it. I oblige and after a few seconds she asks if I could feel anything yet, and as I say no I felt our connection vibrate and glow blue and suddenly I am somewhere pitch black and confused. I feel a terrible presence enter and I crumble to the ground, trembling, and too afraid to look. I felt dirtier than ever before, and he chides me and tells me how minuscule and pathetic I looked. He said LOOK AT YOU, ARE YOU A COWARD? Pushing past the fear I muster \"I'm not a coward, I'm A FUCKING WARRIOR!\" And he says THEN GET UP AND START ACTING LIKE ONE! And I leapt up to my feet and bellowed a terrible roar as if to challenge heaven itself, my body ripped and muscles and veins bulging and a readiness to tear evil limb from limb. I realize no one is there, and I fade from that state of consciousness. I awaken on my back yet off the ground somewhere outside, a medium sized tree in the background, but I was surrounded by several figures. I didn't move. Only one of the figures looked human, like the ideal form of man but seemingly made of concrete. He wore a skull cap and trousers and a slight smirk. The rest I can hardly describe, but two of them in front of me looked vaguely humanoid, one had one eye and one had too many. They all held jars in their hands at center height. I start to fade out again as the figures close in around me with their jars and sticking my limbs in them and then I wake up on the barstool again next to the woman. She tells me I did well and I ask her who the statue man was, she said that was Adam. Then I woke up.\n\nHappened about a week before a beloved pet of mine died that helped pull me out of a downspiral, war experience had taken a toll on my humanity but he reminded me of just how human I still was. I took it better than I feared and expected. I only told my wife and a couple of friends, one was understanding and helpful  and one I think was weirded out and I lost contact with. Seems pretty straight forward but I figure I'd share it and see if anyone's had similar experiences or comments. Thanks for reading!"

Would appreciate any ideas concerning meaning and interpretations. \n- - -\nI was in my old school in performing school play. Filling in for someone who was sick. When it came time to perform I knew not where to go and where to be, making a complete fool of myself - I did not realize we were performing that day! After a brief interval I decide to make a better effort. I go out to take my seat for this lottery scene, as I do someone comes to me and says there is a bomb on stage. \n\nI take my place finding a jacket with my name on it. A woman leans over and starts to speak into a hidden tape recorder of the various items she finds and suspects might be linked to the bomb. But she forgets we are still onstage and so we both must pretend it‚Äôs part of the play. At this moment I open this letter on the table. This igniter slips from the letter and flies forward toward a book with a magnet. It starts glowing red. And I realize I‚Äôve activated the bomb. \nI stand up. Flip the table throwing the bomb away and yell ‚Äúrun‚Äù. I run for the door. People don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. A few moments later people exit the theatre, the ambulance and police arrive. The bomb went off and ten people died. \n\nAfterwards I am felt with guilt. As I caused the death of these ten people by throwing the bomb away. As I am looking out the window I see these three men seated together outside. I can see on their faces that they are my enemies, they have something against me. I realise then that these men were the ones who carried out the bombing. A few moments later the police let them go and they escape."

    "body": "I graduated from school recently. So in my dream I was also having a graduation, but it was on a cruise ship. The ship was deep into the sea when a tidal wave came and knocked the ship over. I was inside in my room when all this happened, but I had an aerial view of the disaster.\n\nI hit my head I fainted. It must‚Äôve been days later when I woke up. I could tell that I was deep deep in the ocean. I‚Äôve always been kind of a loner, so, when I got out of my cabin and looked everywhere, no one was there. The first few floors were completely flooded. I had no way to get out even if I wanted to. If I could get out where would I go? Even if I had special equipment, I doubt I would be able to make it. The pressure of the water would probably kill me first. Then it would likely be the nitrate bubbles from swimming upwards too fast. Even if I somehow made it up to the surface alright, I‚Äôd be lost in the middle of the sea. So I had no choice but just wait. I ate the food that was still okay to eat. \n\nI think I passed down in the dream. Because in the later parts, I had a swim outside the ship and get some food that was just outside. I work at a Bakery in real life and that‚Äôs the food that was there. Cakes and croissants that are just looking nasty from being underwater but I had to get them. One of the head chef‚Äôs for my job was there helping me."

    "body": "First post here, i am a 24 years old male, kinda introvert, there was something bugging me from years,since i have 7 years if i remember correctly, almost all my dreams take place in a Floating continent in Darkness, 3 times the size of earth,since i was little a LOT of my dreams takes place here, and is easy to know, because everytime i see the sky in my dream world is always black devoid of stars,there are only 2 smalls suns, a huge moon with a missing part in it,and a weird Red Star or glow in the darkness that only appear around  middle night, and if you get outside while the red star is glowing a lot of horrible creatures that looks like shadows from afar will appear all around the place,and it last for a hour if someone is outside,if all the people are inside buildings, the star will glow for 1 minute and disappear,so is safe to hide when that happens,describing my dream world perfectly is hard, because there is still a lot of places that i dont have reached yet, a simple description is a huge mass of land with a really tall spike mountains in the center, there are forest,plains,caves,swamps,deserts and really cold places, in the center,where the mountain is,there is a huge city in there,in one of my dreams i remember entering the capitol and there being a huge map of the world in there,a lot of places are unknown, there are varius cities and villages, and ruins too in the south east there is a village where you can reach a ocean,but the ocean from my dream world is weird,cause is alive,not like alive with fish and plants, the ocean itself is a sentient being, it will move around the continent from time to time,so the people living there settled around places were it tends to stop for at least 2 days, is full of life too, there are fish plants and the like but there is not ocean floor,only the void from below the continent. it can get agressive too if people hunt to much fish from it or when the red star is shining, so it will tend to destroy villages close to the cliff borders of the continent. the days are kinda normal,the sky is black but there is light from the suns,clouds and rains.but like in the earth where the atmosfere is blue that dont happen there,about the era of civilization is weird, some cities are modern,some are from the past, and there are no airplanes, or methods to travel in the sky, only cars,horses or being in the ocean when is moving around the continent. in one of the cities around north there is a huge bridge,is really long and big,people can cross it without problem, i have seen another continent in the other side,but i cant cross it,i have died already 3 times trying crossing it,the first i was shot by a robber,i could feel my blood flowing from my wound and the loss of my senses, when i died that time i was only 11 years old, so i got really scare,another time i was crossing in a car and around halfway the bridge huge shadow arms came from below the bridge and pushed me and others cars to the void, other time i tried again and before reaching on foot halfway the bridge the red star appeared and i got killed by the monsters, it was not painful lucky me,but up close they are hideous,they where decaying and not humanoid like,they where a deformity if you could say. after dying 3 times crossing i havent tried anymore,or at least,any more dreams close to that bridge havent appear anymore. i have die more times but in other places, one place is a part where there is a crater and inside that crater is a forest,in the middle is a lake with a perpetual tornado in it, i think i was around 8 years old when in a dream i died there,i could feel the tornado picking me up and throwing me really far away and before i crashed to the ground i woke up sweating.i remember a small urban zone in the top of the crater with grave holes empty and various persons around,they didnt say anything about the empty graves. in the city there are always a lot of persons,persons that i dont know or have seen in my life,they can talk,interact and have feelings,but when i ask about the other continent or about the weird red star they get dead silent and the surrounding too,they stop blinking and it gets creepy and unconfortable,so i tend to leave or change the topic quickly. is a extensive place, i dare say that i have explored only 10 or 20% of that place,and mostly cities,villages,forest or ruins.some ruins give me a bad vibe and a feeling that i should leave,one of the most impactful ruins i visited was a long passage around 2 cliff that was dark,in the wall there where various statues of persons really huge,they all where without head,only bodies,and they where tall like a 5 floor high building, in the end of the passage there was a big stone wall with bones and a broken door, inside that area there was thousands of giants bone arms reaching the sky from the ground, there was a heavy fog around and i got a feeling that i was being observed,in the middle there was something behind the fog that was looking me, i got chills and gose pumps around my body and something was telling me inside to run, so i did and in the passage i hear a creepy and chilly scream coming from there that woke me up scared and crying, it was around  when i was 10 or so  it gived me a scare.there is even more but it would be really long, what i want to know is,why i cant cross that bridge,and why the place is that weird?. oh and about the dreams that dont hapen in that place,they happen in earth and tends to be really cosmic like."

    "body": "So to start off, I‚Äôm a 30-something male married to a 30-something female. I hardly ever remember my dreams. Like, ever. That‚Äôs why this is strange to me that I remember this one. In fact, during the dream, it felt so much like reality that when I woke up, I thought that I was dreaming.\n\nI‚Äôm not particularly proud of the dream, although I‚Äôm very curious of its meaning.\n\nThe dream: \nI don‚Äôt remember much about the setting now, the colors, etc. but I recall there being two sofas in a room. The room was relatively small, I‚Äôm thinking maybe 12-14 foot wide by 20 foot long, can‚Äôt remember the height though I feel like the ceilings were low. The space felt sort of cozy. On one of the sofas was my wife, alone‚Ä¶ she may have been sleeping there, can‚Äôt recall. On the other sofa was me and another female. I don‚Äôt recall a face (other than thinking she was gorgeous) or a name. The only thing I really remember is that she had tattoos that were very deep in meaning to her. One I was so intrigued about was on her upper chest. I can‚Äôt remember the subject matter in the tattoo now but I do remember that it was rectangle in shape and the subject matter existed inside of the rectangle. I almost feel like it was a cup or a kettle on a stove. I do remember the other tattoo, it was on her right hand and wrist, like ocean coral and shells. It was vibrant and detailed. I can recall a feeling in the dream. Like this other female was an acquaintance but we both felt something for each other while feeling like I was trying to be discreet about that with my wife directly across from us. I don‚Äôt recall doing anything necessarily inappropriate other than sitting extremely close. \n\nFurther context: I will admit, I‚Äôve felt lonely for a while now. My wife doesn‚Äôt come to bed with me and when she does, she never sleeps close to me or really acknowledges that I exist there. Sometimes I wake up when she‚Äôs getting into bed but I‚Äôll lay there with my eyes closed to see if she acknowledges me at all‚Ä¶ and no, she just lays there, turned the other way on her cellphone. She‚Äôs usually good otherwise, taking care of the kids, the house‚Ä¶ we have fun together, but it feels more like a roommate dynamic (even with our children) now rather than a marriage.\n\nCan anyone help to decipher this dream in some way? I probably wouldn‚Äôt really care if I remembered more of my dreams. I just find it quite odd that this is one I do remember. Thank you."

I ran into my parents there for some odd reason. This old but fashionable woman that I didn‚Äôt know approached me and complimented a fur coat I was wearing. I said thank you. Later I went back to my room to discover that the door was open. The old woman came out carrying another coat of mine, and offered to trade this fur vest in exchange for the other coat. I told her that I didn‚Äôt want the vest but she could just have the coat anyway since I didn‚Äôt really like it anyway. Throughout the beginning of the dream she kinda just kept popping up where I was and being super kind to me. Later I was just hanging in my hotel room and checked my bank balance and it was less than I‚Äôd thought but the statements were consistent with where I‚Äôd been so I figured I‚Äôd just spent more than I thought. My card was still in my wallet. I checked again later and my balance just kept dropping and dropping. I tried to freeze my account but my bank app kept loading.

I‚Äôve tried psychedelics, DMT, etc. They came very close, but the elements are still found solely in my dreams. The feelings‚Ä¶ are simply indescribable. But they show that reality is halved and repressed.   \n\nSome of the only ways I can describe them, a sense filled me, I knew what was happening, it was so devastating and beautiful; I was being destroyed and reminded - all that was familiar, all reference points, all identity -- all viciously shattered and reformed in moments. I can‚Äôt even recognize the feelings, they‚Äôre unrecognizable - just a momentary glimpse of the other side, of the other feelings.  \n\nSo extreme and vivid, in one dream, on a roof on a building, again, reality is morphed, but still recognizable. I was with someone, it wasn‚Äôt love. The feeling, of everything. How our sociality confounded itself in this dream, how it linked together, the epitome - essence of it, you could feel it. So beautiful. They and I‚Ä¶ we knew each other. The aftertaste is so beautiful and vivid. So entrancing and consuming, it absorbs me with each phase of thought and every note. So inexplicable. I find myself enslaved but it, like a cleansing rain it washes over the me, this indescribable feeling. the most INTENSE feeling on this planet. I can taste the aftertaste, the glimpses are so beautiful, before it becomes lost to a black void I can only barely remember.  \n\nThe feelings, of equilibrium like in some of my dreams, in some dreams, it‚Äôs the strongest ever, Very vivid. The environment and it‚Äôs entirety plotted out in semblances of quintessence. The aftertaste lying in bed is one of the best feelings ever. When I woke up, I felt a longing, a desire for something that isn't possible. It‚Äôs so ecstatic. I felt a strange euphoria and happiness. I could taste the afterthought of the emotion, but couldn't connect it to an existing physical meaning like with normal emotions.  \n\nEvery second of my life I spend longing for the dreams, I oversleep so often, just hoping that the feelings return. I cry everyday‚Ä¶ the feelings are so powerful."

I have to fight, and sincerely resist this force and cannot be overtaken by it.\n\nThis time, however I‚Äôm adding in the lines ‚ÄúI banish you back to hell from whence you came‚Äù ‚Äúbe gone‚Äù, and I recall the entity gets forced down a hall and into room, where the door shuts.

We got a call from one of our friends (who it was is unknown, but the feeling was \"friend\") who let us know they had a dream that the world was about to end. \n\nWe looked online to see if there was anything going on, and basically there was a sudden countdown timer for, like, 5 minutes until doomsday. There wasn't any specific event that was predicted, just The End and everyone would die. \n\nI went through all the stages of grief in my dream in a very short time and before we knew it, my husband I were just holding each other waiting for The End (or not). I didnt think it would happen until my consciousness saw a massive red dust wave just whoosh across the planet (i was omniscient for a moment) in about 4 seconds, then i saw it over his shoulder coming for us, and then it was all black. \n\nThe next thing that happened is I was a thought, all encompassing, in the cosmos. I had no body, no form, just consciousness. I spoke to my husband there and also everyone else on earth who had died- we were all one with private conversations happening simultaneously. We thought, \"hey, this isn't so bad!\" Until a giant blackhole opened in the heart of the very universe itself and the universe started imploding. \n\nWe all watched as planets, stars, images of war, memes, ideas, everything material and not material that we know (but was MADE into an image being sucked in, it had a physical symbol, if that makes sense) was destroyed until the edges of the universe closed in on us like a pool of water going down a drain. \n\nNothingness. But obviously, I didn't know because I wasn't there. Next thing that happened, I woke up next to my husband and a similar day replayed- but I had given him a trinket during the 5 minute doomsday countdown, and he still had it with him so we remembered everything that had just happened and it was over. \n\nMy initial thoughts are stress, but I FELT so high, so free, so powerful being in the cosmos. It was a physical feeling in my body of just lightness. And the reborn, the symbolism, the trinket- it seems a bit deeper to me. \n\nThank you in advance!"

In the dream, it kept trying to bite me. Eventually, the rattlesnake's head was separated from its body. I think I might've had some type of sword/knife/stick that I was using to defend myself, and I may have slashed its head off in the dream, but I don't remember that happening. \n\nI continued to dream that, after I did this, the snake's body continued to lunge at me. The head, separate from the body, also kept moving toward me, somehow moving in a slithering motion, but also bouncing at times. I don't remember if I dreamt it bit me-- I believe in the dream that it either did, or came close. It kept flashing its fangs at me threateningly.\n\nSome context-- I'm a 26-year old male in a graduate program. Recently, I've been struggling after a friend of mine took their own life about a month ago. I wonder if the dream has anything to do with that. Another important piece of context is that I'm not really afraid of snakes. I'm terrified of spiders and scorpions, but I've always been fascinated by snakes (except for the gross muscle-y constrictor snakes) and don't have any type of phobia of them."

The puppy is lucky!‚Äù So that gave me the courage to help free the puppy from the alligator/crocodile. I told the other people I was with to help so they did.

She kept swapping doors for a good 5 minutes then I heard all the faculty yelling. They were all running down the hallway but they weren't able to move past a certain point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a getting shot at a few more times, I picked up a fire extinguisher and used it to block a bullet before throwing at her.

It was so vivid that it has been years and I can't still forget about it.\n\nI was walking in the middle of the street, within the crowd and there was a man following me. Rather than feeling threatened, I felt comfortable and safe instead. I was much older there, around mid-20s. Same for the man who seemed to be in his late 20s. There were stalls at the side and there are some people selling various things like the ones you can see when you go to a night market. Both of us were wearing pants and shirts and he has a clean cut of hair. I had a long straight hair there, my curly hair is inborn.\n\nAnd then, while we were walking, we were just looking around, sight-seeing, having smiles on our lips while enjoying the surroundings. After some minutes, we finally arrived at the destination. It was at the countryside and there was a house made of wood and cement there. The house is built under a huge tree and at the side, you can see the rice fields. \n\nWe went inside the house. It is actually fully furnished but it looked like it was being abandoned after a celebration. You can see the food sitting on the table, untouched. You can see confetti on the floor, the balloons, the decorations still hanged up on the walls. And then, we went inside a certain room and we saw a bunch of baby items like blankets, clothes, etc. In every clothing there, the baby's name is embroidered. The man and I didn't really talk at all, throughout the whole time but when I picked up one of the blankets, we smiled lovingly while looking at the embroidered name.\n\nSometimes, I believe that this man from my dream is actually the right person for me but still, I haven't seen him yet."

One of my closest friends and someone I‚Äôve always loved.\n\nSomehow I instinctually knew that on some spiritual level we were (for a lack of a better term) both drawing the same energy.\n\nIf life was some magnetic axis, she and I are both north (or both south)\n\nBoth Yin or both Yang.\n\nAnd for this reason I knew that the two of us being together meant we were drawing in the same type of energy, making it positive, and the demonic force could never return because of this.\n\nThink of it like we‚Äôre slowly building up our ‚Äúki‚Äù and it‚Äôs acting like a force field.\n\nBut not just for stopping evil things but it felt like luck in general.\n\nLike somehow I knew my chances of random bad things happening like stubbing my toe or a tire blowing out all the way up to heart attacks would be lower\n\nAnd random good things like stumbling across a winning lottery ticket would be higher.\n\nI went to pay her some platonic compliment and I felt she took it the wrong way because she responded ‚ÄúI just need more time‚Äù as if she just recently divorced or lost her husband.\n\nAt this point the dream cuts to me walking into the house of a blonde girl that looks like a movie star I‚Äôve always admired, and when she looked her best too.\n\nShe took my hand and introduced me as her boyfriend which thrilled me.\n\nBut then it‚Äôs like a silent narrator just telepathically told me that despite how good she is (physically, mentally, emotionally) something about her (in an almost horoscope bullshit sort of way) meant she was on the other axis.\n\nNot even just neutral but one that would be negative and drain all that good juju I had built up earlier.\n\nRight then I knew if I stayed with her it would be constant misfortune. No chance at the lottery , if anything I‚Äôd get robbed randomly and lose money.\n\nNot because she‚Äôs bad in any way (I can‚Äôt emphasize that enough) but because she just brought bad luck.\n\nSo she tried to lead me up stairs , a moment I‚Äôve probably wished would happen with this actress in dreams for years but all I could think about was that the demon from earlier would pop out at any moment now.\n\nMy protection was gone and would soon become anti-protection (like a beacon for bad things)\n\nBut I wanted to stay with her anyway. \n\nAs I type this the meaning seems almost too obvious. The first girl is the right girl. But can it really be that simple?"

I cant determine what this dream would mean in all honesty, but last night the dream I had was about a pendant that a group of people and I found. Now I can‚Äôt remember ever seeing what the front of the pendant looked like, I just remember holding it up to others and seeing the back of it, getting an idea of what it looked like. But I have more of a feeling that the pendant was some kind of green color, and it had metal swirls around it, the pendant itself was circular. Now nothing ever happened to me when I held it, but I felt like I had to be it‚Äôs protector, it‚Äôs keeper, because I‚Äôm the hands of everyone else it gave off a really bad vibe of like evil, or angry energy coming off of it. When it was in the hands of those who touched it though, their faces kind of distorted. They went to like a weird shape and than back to a whole new constructed face. They didn‚Äôt look bad or anything, just unrecognizable and like they‚Äôre someone completely new. I‚Äôm the end of this dream I ripped the pendant out of someone‚Äôs hand and kept it myself and said I was gonna take the pendant and put it up in a clear frame, because of the energy the pendant was letting off. I dont know exactly what this dream was trying to communicate, but I know that something is trying to be told to me. When I dream all the time, I write down a lot of things and interpret different parts of my dreams and connect them all together to get to the bottom of the message."

    "body": "Last night I dreamt about being in a place that I‚Äôve dreamt of before, though it was quite a bit different than the last time I dreamt of it. It was a place that I knew to be a really big school with a lay-out too confusing for myself to know go to get around, so it was easy to get lost/lose my bearings. The first time I‚Äôve dreamt of the school, it was a good dream.\n\nAlthough it was a school and had classrooms and a lunch room, it also had multiple different apartment buildings in it. Each apartment had a different lay-out as well as having two ways to get in and out, each leading to a hallway with multiple doors leading to more apartments, or different school rooms. There WAS a way to eventually get outside, but at one outside area you needed a vehicle to bring out out and at another side it was completely fenced in. \n\nThere was a set of twins (male and female), each having their own sword. Their purpose of being there was to protect everyone. \nMy boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) were in a lunchroom, and he grabbed a couple of beverages out of the vending machine and drank them before leaving - I grabbed one beverage out of the vending machine, and before I could open it, the lights went out. \n\n(This next part starts to get kind of graphic, so possible TW)\nI used my phone for a flashlight and found my way out of the room into the hallway and then into an apartment-style room. There I saw the two twins and some other people, but something was corrupting the twins. The twins exchanged their swords with one another and started crying blood before cutting the side of the other‚Äôs neck just enough to bleed. Immediately after, the twins started killing everyone in the room - I was in a bit of shock, but then left the room to run into a different room.\n\nI could hear the door to the room the twins were in open and then close, so I kept running to find the door in the room to bring me into the next one away from them. It was also at this point that I somehow knew that my 5yo son was around somewhere as well, so I was also running to try and find him. \n\nThere was one room I ran into but couldn‚Äôt find the way out of the other side of it, so I hid in a closet. The twins came into the room, and while looking in the bathroom I ran out to a different one. I eventually ran into someone else that was hiding in a closet with my son - he was so terrified that he couldn‚Äôt make a sound but he looked like he was trying to scream - I think he thought I might have been the twins until he realized that it was me instead. \n\nUpon the realization, he clung to me. The woman that was hiding with him said she had found him hiding under a super low shelf - I then asked her if it was super obvious that he was hiding there and she said that she didn‚Äôt realize he was there until he came out once he realized that t was a safe person. I was relieved upon hearing that.\n\nWe knew that we had to keep going to stay ahead of the twins, so we looked for the other door that would lead out. I noticed in the closet there was a little bit of a platform higher up, so. Lifted my son up there, but he was scared saying ‚Äúno, no, no‚Äù - I reassured him we were all going to go together, but that he had to go first and I would follow and the seemed to do the trick.\n\nI went up next, and then the other woman followed. I realized there were dim lights on that we could not turn off and I was worried that we would be found from that alone if we stayed, so I looked around and noticed the closet went further down (but only in this upper part) and that there was a door on the other side. We all went through to find ourselves in another room. We went through quite a few more rooms before coming across one with a lot of other people inside. \n\nEveryone here seemed to be under the impression that they were safe, so they had music playing very loud and were hanging around like there wasn‚Äôt any danger lurking. I put my son up into the top of the closet as it had a deep upper part that went further than the  closet itself before going down and unplugging the music and telling them they were endangering everyone there. They told me to stfu and that they were fine, and then plugged the music back in. \n\nI went into the top of the closet but did not see my son - he was down below looking for me, so I grabbed him and brought him up with me. We then hid in the super far back near the door to the next room. Someone was pacing back and forth in that room, and I woke up as I was going to go through the door to talk to them."

    "body": "Last night, a portion of my dream was devoted to being cut in half.\n\nIf anyone is familiar with the series Chainsaw Man, I was taking the place of the main character Denji. I was running away from a threat with some allies in a metropolitan setting. The threat appeared to be a fairly normal looking young adult woman who appeared to have gone wild and enraged from stress. Her demeanor kind of matched how I've been wanting to vent my anger and frustration internally after how the last couple of years have left me feeling unfulfilled and completely alienated. I can place anger towards others, but I cannot place blame on them or myself for what has happened. I can't hate anyone over it.\n\nThe only thing abnormal about this woman was the immense strength she used with a knife to gruesomely cut diagonally through my torso and right arm, right on through to the person on my left as well. Both of us went down and I was very aware of the fact that my legs were no longer attached to my body.\n\nIn the moment, I was taking in how rough the wounds felt. The woman had mounted over my body to impale me a few, slow times. Despite this, I felt very calm and I did not actually feel in danger at all. It didn't feel like murder. My head on its side against cobblestone could look up to see the woman with a quivering expression of wild anger. Tears rolled down her cheeks, her eyes trying not to cry themselves shut. Strained giggles escaped her between sobs.\n\nI only really sensed a budding empathy for her. As the dream started to wrap up, I felt mostly calm and safe. I knew that in a dream, it was a safe space for these ugly emotions to come out. Though really, I don't got much of my own ideas for why I was cut in half, and I am curious to know what others think of this."

She and I still get physical sometimes (she says her husband is okay with it) and will even pretend to be girlfriends, so sometimes it feels like our relationship and feelings are deeper than \"just friends\".*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn my dream, I was hanging out with my ex at her house and a few random girls we had met at the bar (not girls I know in real life, my brain just made them up). I remember feeling left out and not included for most of the time. She was flirting with these girls and playing with their hair, letting them lay on her, etc. (all stuff that she typically does with me in real life). At one point, my ex asked me to go outside and get something for her (I don't remember what it was), but I went outside and it was dark because it was nighttime. I was looking for the thing she wanted me to get and I came across this snake. It was huge, mostly light green with some large black diamond shapes on it and [looked like this](https://br.pinterest.com/pin/682295412270638671/). Not sure what it actually was, but I knew for a fact it wasn't a local species where I live (Midwest U.S.) I didn't see it at first and startled it, so it hissed at me and started standing up. I backed away and told the snake, \"I'm really sorry, I didn't see you there\" and then it left me alone.\n\nThen, one of my ex's neighbors came over to me and asked me if I wanted him to kill the snake for me. Again, this isn't someone I know, my brain just made him up. I told him no and it was fine, the snake wasn't bothering me anymore and I had just startled it. I kept looking for whatever it was I supposed to be getting, and I found a second snake. This one was a lot smaller, with a brownish-red banding pattern. I'm not sure if it was a local species, but it definitely looked a lot less exotic, [sort of like this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/73683441@N07/16795702747). This time I didn't startle the snake, so we made eye contact but left each other alone and I moved on to keep looking.\n\nAfter that, this big animal that resembled a panda bear came up to me and started nibbling on my hand and grabbed onto me. It was really friendly, but it was very clingy and latched on to me with its arms and would not let go. I remember thinking that it must have been a baby that had lost its mom. I was trying to look it up on my phone to found out what type of animal it was. While I was doing that, my ex came outside to see what was taking me so long and to make sure I was okay. I told her everything that had happened and when I got done explaining, I noticed that the panda-like animal was gone. I also tried to show her the snakes, but I found them both dead on the ground tied up against a spear. The neighbor said he killed them because they were dangerous, but then I got very upset and told him that they weren't bothering anyone, this was their home too, and they didn't deserve to die. After that, my ex and I spent the rest of the dream trying to find the panda-like animal because I wanted to save it."

The rats started off on top of my freezer. I mistakenly pushed them onto the kitchen floor. The rat on top never once let go of the other rat. It just kept nibbling.\nI have a small gerbil, so I‚Äôm not afraid of pet rats. However, the huge rat on top really made me feel uneasy. I wasn‚Äôt exactly afraid of it, but it just evoked some bad feelings. The bottom rat was still alive. It wasn‚Äôt moving and it was very weak, but it was still alive. I felt sad for it because I knew it could still feel pain.\nI tried to find some rat poison to kill the top rat, but I couldn‚Äôt find any. After that, I woke up still feeling uneasy. Even now (maybe 10 minutes later, I still feel that way). I always look for interpretations of my animal dreams but couldn‚Äôt find anything this morning. Help?"

I was walking along some kind of water, not sure if it was a lake, or river. I remember seeing a lot of snakes. Then we (my boyfriend and I) came upon my dog and a either a crocodile or alligator. They had my dogs leg in their mouth when I approached it it released my dog and my boyfriend tried to come behind it and grab my dog out of harms way but it turned around and grabbed my dogs leg again. It had to be shot a few time before it released my dog. We scooped up my dog and tried to rinse blood from him so I could see how bad his injuries were. Both his front legs had about half of his fur gone. Then I noticed the bite may have gotten an artery in his arm because the blood wouldn‚Äôt stop. I immediately applied pressure and screamed for someone to drive us. No one could drive and I begged someone to call 911. That‚Äôs when I woke up."

    "body": "Basically I woke up in a cold sweat because off this dream. I‚Äôm not someone that usually dreams but this one really stuck with me. So I want to know what this might mean.\n\nIn the dream I was standing in front of my uncle and his fianc√©s house. Now, this doesn‚Äôt seem too weird, but I haven‚Äôt seen them in ages yet their house was fully detailed in the dream. Another thing I noticed was that everything seemed to be 90‚Äôs themed. The cars, houses, decorations, the whole vibe of the dream. \n\nI was waiting in front off their garden when I (in the dream) remembers someone telling me to not take the medicine. I‚Äôm confused as I stand there when a car pulls up beside me. The people inside are having fun and laughing as the driver offers me a packet of prescribed medication. I decline but they continue to insist until the car I‚Äôm waiting for arrives. The others drive off. \n\nThe person?, that earlier told me not to take the medicine tells me that my ‚Äústep cousin‚Äù is taking the medicine. I get into the car that is supposed to take me to my soccer game. (I haven‚Äôt played soccer for over two years now.) Anyway we make small talk in the car when the stranger that sit beside me offers me another package of the same prescribed medication. I tell her off but she continues to insist and tells me that it‚Äôs much better and healthier to take. That it will make me feel much better. A warning flag goes off in my head and I ignore her for the rest off the ride. The driver which is someone I know (not in real life, idk who that was) then proceeds to take a wrong turn and drives to a nearby health centre.\n\nI‚Äôm confused but follows the others inside. In the centre everyone is working and the driver guide me to an office while she talks about how good and necessary the medication is. She then tells me that she‚Äôs almost finished with making the medication legal. She then offers me some of the pills. I ask to read the labels but she just laugh at my question. She then tells me to either take the pills or I will get the medicine injected. I start panicking and ask her about the soccer game. She tells me that we will go there when I take the medication. \n\nI try to look for an exit but she just laughs and yet again tells me to take the medication. She then leans down to my ear and tells me that the pills are much, much better than the injections. And that only fools take the injections. She then hands me the packet of pills. The dreams end shortly after."

And I‚Äôm pretty sure I was in Louisiana even though I‚Äôve never actively been in Louisiana. (I‚Äôve passed through Louisiana once.) I noticed that the trolley lines were intersecting with the regular vehicle lanes, and there were stoplights. \nThe first stoplight, I realized I was breaking too hard and not in time enough and I told myself that I need to pay attention. At the second light, my passenger side got hit with a trolley. I have a very little car IRL but the trolley was more damaged than my vehicle. Before I get out of the car, I noticed that two black, older men were conducting it. One was drinking out of a Bud Light beer can and the other man was smoking a joint. And I asked myself if my insurance good so I started freaking out and trying to find anything to use against the conductors like smoking weed and drinking alcohol while driving the trolley. So I got out and I called my mother and she‚Äôs not paying attention, she‚Äôs cutting me off, she can‚Äôt hear me, every excuse under the sun for her to explain to me at the bare minimum, that she could not grasp what I was trying to ask her. In the meantime, the two men that were conducting, it turned into two very attractive men. So attractive that I got nervous and embarrassed, even more so since I was blocking traffic.\nI got mad, I was scared, and I was trying to experience some intense back pain and started cursing at her and yelling at her, and so forth. And then she had my sister on the phone trying to fuss at me for it. \nI proceeded to tell my sister she‚Äôs the last person to start passing judgment, or pass any advice to anyone on how to do their life or be responsible. I guess we were on FaceTime and I saw that she had a newborn baby girl on her chest. I am a Santa Muerte Devotee, so I started praying to Her to let this be a dream.\n\nIRL: \nI woke up at exactly 0130, on the way to the bathroom I thanked Santa Muerte for letting that being just a dream.\n\nMy mom is not the best person to talk to in emergencies. And the relationship I have with my sister isn‚Äôt perfect (and even recently she tried to belittle me like we‚Äôre children again, even though we are 10 years apart and full grown adults), she has three boys I want to say the youngest is maybe three and she cannot have any more children. \n\nHelp."

    "body": "I am one to believe dreams have meanings but usually don‚Äôt often have nightmares or dreams that are disconcerting enough to care to find out what they mean. However I had a series of nightmares last night which weren‚Äôt entirely all that bad I think just due to a lack of vividness, though they were VERY out of the my dreaming norm and played out as a series of dreams all with the same unnerving theme.\n\nThroughout these dreams I found myself running from a sort of sinister evil or evil spirit that was hunting people down and killing them. The first dream involves me working at some unfamiliar store where people began to die spontaneously on shift but we were expected to stay. Remaining staff and I realized the cause was staring into the reflection of an old TV in the store because when doing so, intense fear and the feeling of an evil presence would wash over you. I don‚Äôt know why but I kept wanting to look into it to figure out exactly what it was and a feeling of impending doom grew each time until I finally sprinted out of the store and ran to my car and sped out of the parking lot like my life depended on it, feeling like if I wasn‚Äôt out of there fast enough, I was next.\n\nSimilar scenarios repeated in smaller dreams I had later on in the night where I kept finding myself wanting to investigate these very malevolent energies coming from reflections.  I think I wanted to investigate both out of curiosity and a hope that it would go away. One small dream involved me looking into the reflection of the sliding glass door in my kitchen and would feel waves of fear wash over me but nothing happened. Another dream didn‚Äôt involve a reflection I recall but involved me being in my house with a coworker of mine and sprinting outside to my car while desperately pleading with this coworker to come outside and get in the car with me all while they were confused and asking my why. One last related one involved my walking down the street past the store from the first dream to see if the evil energy was still there and killing the workers.\n\nFinally, this last one was a little different and didn‚Äôt feel scary to me in the moment but was very creepy and sinister in nature. I was in this very old dingy apartment that was very colorless and filled with dusty sunlight. There were a bunch of friendly but timid monsters living together on this floor I was on. They were all just lifelessly doing nothing while I was desperately searching all the rooms for something. They did not bother me until I opened a door that led to an attic above. As soon as I did all the monsters started fearfully and angrily screaming and yelling NOOO!!! NOO!!! And suddenly blood starts pouring down the stairs and I feel fear wash over me and I sprint outside and begin running from the apartment building. I look back and from a dormer window on the roof I see two creatures watching me, one large and one small- one white with large black voids for eyes and one black with large white voids for eyes. I run as fast as I can but they continue to watch me until finally from a third person perspective I watch my eyes melt out of my head and my body collapse to its knees. It felt like I turned into one of the monsters living in that place.\n\nI don't usually have dreams like this, let alone a series of them all night. I'm mostly unbothered about it but am also very curious what it all could mean if it does mean something. I'm at a relatively good place in life right now and have been doing good inner work so it's not something I would expect to be within me with this sudden intensity at this moment in time. What are your thoughts?"

    "body": "I was 8 or 10 years old (2007-08) when I used to get frequent dreams about a place. So in the dream there is a 4-way rotary intersection with a central island and wide median strip on each way and my dad and I are standing on the left lane of the road whereas my mom and sister are taking the bus on the opposite lane. This is then the dream ends. I've had this same dream for many years when I was child. The intersection looked very beautiful and way too modern for that time.\n\nWhen I turned 18 or so (around year 2015) , I needed to go to a different city for some works with my dad. This is the city which is approximately 60 kms away and I had never been there. So I was driving the car and my dad was sitting on the passenger sit. The road network was in rectangular pattern and after crossing a few intersections, I was right at the same spot I used to get dreams of. It immediately clicked me that I'm on the same lane, and there is this bus coming on the opposite lane and that there is a median in between to separate the opposite traffic. Except that my mom and sister weren't there and they weren't taking the bus, it was me and my dad only there. \n\nBut everything I saw in those dreams happened right back at that time and at that intersection. I was driving my car right at the same spot I was standing in my dreams several years ago. That moment was so crazy at that time that the dejavu lasted for quite a long time until I reached at another intersection."

We sit for a bit and I talk her through how we need to leave and form an escape plan but she doesn‚Äôt agree and is only going along with it.\n\nI break free and we run outside, there‚Äôs a fence with a clear exit to the main road through an alley way so I run and jump it. I look back to get my girlfriend to jump too and she struggles but gets over. At this point I‚Äôm excited to be out but she stops and tells me no, we need to go back. I‚Äôm very confused because we were handcuffed in an attic, why would we go back? But she says that no they were in fact going to cook for us and I need to. I plead with her to just come with me because I just want to go home and be safe but she turns around and goes back in. \n\nAt this point I walk off and one of the guys comes out of the house chasing me. I run off shouting at him how he took me prisoner and that I‚Äôm not coming back but as I run I get slower and slower. He catches up but says I‚Äôm not worth it and heads home.\n\nI get back to my house and my friends ask me what happened and upset, I tell them. We then hear a knock on the door and I open it to see my girlfriend in nothing but a silk bathrobe with the guys from before all laughing and she throws a pair of scissor at me before I slam the door and she walks off. One of the guys was particularly brutish and tall, he sticks out the most.\n\nIf anyone could make sense of this one then it‚Äôll be much appreciated because I am confused af."

    "body": "I had a dream I was at a school. Tons of guys worked at this school. One of the kids started acting really weird here. I suspected a male staff member had something to do with it but I wasn‚Äôt sure which one so I blamed one guy at a time. Every guy I blamed was fired. I was surprised. I didn‚Äôt realize my words had so much power. Then I found the perpetrator. I caught him on camera. I told the principal. She asked why I felt like I needed proof this time and I said because I plan to press charges.\n\nScene cut I‚Äôm in a break room of some kind. I notice that one of the male staff members that I got fired was there. He was someone I liked a lot and I did not mean to get him fired. I wanted him to notice me so I tried to look cute. \n\nHe ended up noticing me and came over. He said you‚Äôre really toxic you know that. You caused a lot of people to loose their jobs all because of your intuition. You come off so strong and crazy. And you know what I really freaking love that. I was trying so hard not to look at you but you are so cute I couldn‚Äôt help but come over here. \n\nIn my dream I was so happy that he still liked me and did not take my actions personally. Although they were extreme. \n\nThen before I woke up the scene cut again to me being an intern at a news station. They were trying to teach me how to be a news reporting journalist. My dreams often cut to me being an intern at a news station. I‚Äôm not sure why. At this point though my past dream felt like a memory.\n\nAt the news station I was doing my job. I was walking around helping to write news stories as well as weather scripts. Then I was approached by the head anchor. He stopped me and put his hand on my upper arm and said ‚Äú(My Name), I have been seeing you around here lately and I think you‚Äôre really great. Would you like to go get a cup of coffee after work?‚Äù I responded yes and said as long as it‚Äôs appropriate I don‚Äôt mind. He said it was appropriate and went to his chair to start his news cast. \n\nI‚Äôve had this dream multiple times and he would always pay close attention to me. I‚Äôd catch him watching me work sometimes. I figured that was the dream warning me to watch out for people watching me. Until I had this new dream last night. \nA little about the News Anchor; he was older than me, a different race, and he had a face you‚Äôd remember. His face was not always kind, which is why I assumed my other dreams were warnings. But when he touched me I felt like he had good loving intentions and couldn‚Äôt help but smile. \n\nMostly however when I dreamed of being a news station intern I payed very little attention to him and just enjoyed my dream. It was fun being an intern. \n\nOh and one other thing this news station set was very obviously in another realm sort of. It was cloudy looking, shaky and the outside looked like stars in space. Usually my dreams are clear like a memory I am certain of in HD."

    "body": "So a little backstory, me and this girl were together for 3 years and now have been apart for 10 months. I haven‚Äôt thought of her in months and I would like to say I‚Äôm pretty much over her as the relationship ended in her telling me she fell out of love with me. I was hurt at the time but moved on because I had more important things to focus on . I definitely let the breakup run its course though and worked it all out in my head and heart, as it did hurt. But like I said I haven‚Äôt though about her in months and really have no emotions connected to her anymore nor have I been in contact with her since the whole breakup. But anyways I had a really stressful and long day at work and got home early so I took a little nap. During that nap I had a dream where I ended back up at her place and in her room. The dream had a very weird atmosphere and not a good feeling to it. The vibe was definitely off. We were kind of on the opposite sides of the room but still having conversation. I don‚Äôt remember everything in full detail but I do remember her telling me how it was nice seeing me again and it almost felt like she was trying to reconnect with me. She was also saying how it was nice to be around each other again , she complemented me on my looks and was saying how I looked good. We ended up talking a bit more from what I remember but don‚Äôt remember about what exactly. But then before the dream ended‚Ä¶ I started choking , it felt like my whole throat was full of phlegm that I could not get out . After coughing and gagging trying to clear my throat I woke up. I had a really weird feeling upon waking up and everything just didn‚Äôt feel right the rest of the day. Is there any hidden message that just like flew right over my head? Or anything I should take note of? Anything helps, this was such a weird dream and experience and have never had a dream anything like this at all. Even after the breakup I never had a dream like this. Any further questions I‚Äôd be happy to answer but I‚Äôm genuinely confused as to what the dream means.

    "body": "I have come here for help deciphering a reoccurring dream that I've had every night for almost 2 years now, the specifics are slightly different but generally the same vibe. Also, I take 2 types of sleeping medication so it might not even be a dream it could just be chemicals; but anyway,\n\nIt started around 2 years ago after a very stressful event. It began almost like an out of body experience, where I knew I was asleep, I always know I'm asleep, but it felt like I was drifting upwards and could see my body from above. Kinda fun but I also didn't wanna float away too far incase I never came back, it was as if i knew I couldn't float too far away because something not so nice would happen, but still kinda funky. \n\nI'm not sure when, but then they started to get darker. I'd 'wake up', open my eyes and see something in my room, and I started to feel like I was no longer floating up- but going down. I lived alone and ended up moving house where I live with other people. I thought that would make it go away but it hasn't.\n\nNow I'm not scared of it, but its more of an annoyance. I go to sleep, I wake up and I just start dream-punching whatever shadowy figure is beside me until I wake up. The imagined presence doesn't feel like some sort of evil entity, but it's also not very comforting? And it also doesn't feel like the same 'presence' each time. I just don't feel like watching me sleep is a very cool thing to do so like, get out of my house. Last night, it felt as if I was slowly being sucked off my bed and vacuumed downwards. I can always wake myself up by shadowboxing air. Maybe it's sleep paralysis, but why it happens every night I'm not sure. I have a certain trick to get rid of it, and if I do that before bed I never get those dreams- but I'm not always in the mood every single night if you get me\n\nAlso, the dreams never happen if there's someone else physically in my room, like if I'm babysitting a cat or get lucky enough to bring someone home one night.\n\nBut who the hell am I fighting in my sleep?"

Then I seen him again at an event soon after - no introductions yet - but heavy attraction still/eye contact. Several months later ,I saw him again at a large parade where I remember locking eyes intensely through a huge crowd again. A couple of months after that he randomly ended up working for my former boss. We then met and the energy was intense. But nothing came of it and we haven‚Äôt come in contact since. I also learned that he might have a girlfriend.\n\nI should mention that I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, but I‚Äôve been very open lately to share space with someone else.

Especially if you have dreamed about dying before, or even if you had a near death experience, thank you in advance-and I look forward to receiving any sort of feedback„Äã\n\n‚Ä¢My dream starts off with me and my mother sitting in a room, talking on the bed. I then fall off the bed and get some sort of head injury. I begin screaming for my mom, but she walks away to get someone else. I then starting puking this clear liquid, that was causing me issues to breath. She comes back and say \"just breathe\" then she gets on the phone to call my grandma and uncle to give us a ride to the hospital. Well they started arguing, then my mom gets mad and says forget it she's not going to help. I then remember trying to stumble out of the room- but I was unable to see properly. Like my vision was of me in some sort of dark hallway with multiple doors and stairs. I was still calling out to my mom with no help or answer. Somehow I make it outside and cops appear, and so does my mom . At this time, she appears concerned talking about \"someone help her , my baby\" It changed to me in the hospital, in a surgery room. I was awake, and the doctor put some sort of iv into my side/abdominal area. I remember that my brain had a infection, and they was trying to pump antibiotics directly into my stomach. \nThen very vividly-like this felt so real. I started puking, and choking on my own blood. I remember in the dream I felt very fearful but I was trying to stay calm and breath. Like, I felt my \"light\" fading out. I really felt death creep up, slowly. I had enough time to acknowledge the fact that I was dying, and to be scared. Briefly I tried to fight it, then I accepted-even said a small prayer to God something like \"Forgive me father, and if this is my time I accept this. Take me\" once that was said I \"fell unconscious\" in my dream and saw some sort of light. A beautiful welcoming light, i felt a sense of peace, love and longing. Like I really wanted to go, fully ready to set life aside and move on to the light. Once my \"soul\" begin leaving from my body, the dream ended and I woke up. I was very confused, and sad that I was not able to reach the light. Like my first thought was \"I wanted to go\" \n\nI'm not really sure the meaning or message of this dream,but I cannot emphasize enough on how real everything felt. When I was choking I really felt like I was losing my breath. When I was \"dying\" - I really believe I felt the presence of Death itself. Seriously, I woke up sad that I didn't die for real? How strange is that?\n\nAnyway, thank you for taking your time reading this. If you have any insights, or interpretations please leave a comment. I'd love to see how other people see the meaning behind this, or have experienced something similar."

I manage to stab it a few times, and it manages to sink its teeth into my leg. I run away, but it makes its way onto land and I'm now playing hide and seek with it hoping it doesn't find me. I muster some bravery, and I succeed in confronting the shark and cutting it up into pieces, half its body still submerged in the waters right where the hole is. I keep telling my family, \"look! Look! The great white shark we've been trying to kill for generations is *right there!* why won't you help?\" They finally listen and come to the hole, but at this point the shark has already run off, though I get the sense it's only been temporarily defeated.

A few weeks ago, I had a dream I was in an abandoned prison with my buddy, and we were paranormal investigators. Through our investigation, we found an anomaly, and object some strong force was attached to. Down the hall the anomaly showed itself to us, and started counting down from 10. And we started running, my buddy snatched a photo of its disembodied face. And we ran as fast as we could put of the prison. And in my dream, me and my buddy said it was the most wild Paranormal investigation we've ever had. From what I remember it was a lot scarier, and had more story to it than that. Well last night, I had another paranormal investigators dream. It was my buddy and I, and a few other people. This time we were investigating a house that had a murder in it. The victim was burnt to death. I found a spongebob plush that had a demon attached to it, and in the kitchen appeared a girl. And she started talking to us like a normal human and in my dream I actually felt compassion for her. I asked her was she a murderer, and she said no she was the victim. I was chatting and even laughing woth he'd, until we heard a huge boom from the upper floor. It scared us all. Then for some reason we went looking through our binder from previous investigations. And in the binder was THE PICTURE FROM MY DREAM A FEW WEEKS AGO. As we started looking at the picture we noticed the girl had the same face shape and structure as the entity in the photo. And then I said, \"oh my God its the entity from the prison.\" She turned into the entity and said \"surprise!\" And started counting down as we all started running out if the house. She grabbed me and tried to drag me back into the house as I was screaming for help. I then threw the entity in a hole in the back yard and covered her up with dirt and buried her. \n\nSo my question is 1. How come I'm having two connected dreams\n\nAnd 2. What do these dreams mean?"

    "body": "edit: formatting\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI‚Äôd like to preface this by saying I had this dream approximately 8-9 years ago, so I do not remember a lot however I‚Äôll try to write down as much as I can.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTo add some context, I was staying over at my dad‚Äôs since it was Father‚Äôs Day that weekend, and I had already been there for a night or two (this is important later). I was 10-11 at the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt starts with me being in this white ‚Äúspace‚Äù (it was not a room as it had no bounds) and all that filled this place was this bright whiteness, and it was the purest form of white my brain could comprehend. I was the only thing in this place. I became aware that I was \\*me\\*, I know that sounds weird but it was like my physical conscious body got transported into this place. All of a sudden, the voice began to talk to me. The ‚Äúvoice‚Äù did not have a physical being and I could not pin point exactly where it was coming from, as it sounded like it was coming from everywhere. All I remember about the voice was that it was deep and male. Even though I couldn't see it, I could tell it was some sort of powerful being, and that it was far older than me. It began to ask me questions, such as: \"what is your name\" \"how old are you\" \"who are your family members\" \"where are you right now\" \"what day is it\"\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe bizarre thing is that it was specifically asking me questions about my \\*actual\\* self, not my dream version. Something to note too was that I was not afraid of this being, in fact, I felt completely calm and safe. I answered all of its questions truthfully, except my location. I told it I was at my mum‚Äôs, (however, when I answered I fully believed I was there). I could even see myself at my mum's, and feel myself on my bed, despite the fact I was not.Unfortunately that is all of the conversation I could remember, but I know we talked for longer. I then remember hearing two other voices, but it was coming from the real world. At first I couldn‚Äôt recognise them, but then I realised it was my dads and his then girlfriend. They were telling me to wake up.The being was saying its goodbyes to me, being soothing and calming, but I did not want to wake up. I was begging the ‚Äúvoice‚Äù to let me stay but of course, I woke up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nIt really sticks out to me as at that point in my life I was suffering from chronic nightmares and rarely had any ‚Äúgood‚Äù dreams, which is what made this one unique. I'm not sure if I was lucid dreaming or not."

    "body": "First time posting here, I don't dream very often, and I almost never remember my dreams.\n\nLast night was very weird, intense, and I remember it all in unusually vivid details :\n\n\\- one in which I experienced \"sleep paralysis\" - I remember trying to wake up, trying to speak, but not being able to move or say a word. I haven't seen any of the horrible things people sometimes see during SP, but it's a topic I had already read quite a bit about since it has happened to me a few times. I remember thinking \"no problem, remain calm and you will eventually wake up\". That part is foggy but I think I just woke up after a while, and then fell asleep again, and I vividly remember the dreams that followed\n\n\\- The first one is not super interesting, it involved airplanes, I was a passenger in a plane where they had computer screens in place of windows, and what as displayed on the screens did not match the movement of the aircraft, it felt like we were speeding towards our death for what felt like an eternity. I remember seeing two pilots being carried out by doctors through the plane's central aisle and people panicking. Then somehow we land and I find myself flying (like a bird, with no airplane, I remember trying to understand how to \"control\" my movement through the air) through random French towns (that I don't know nor ever went to). I remember landing in Nice while we (two close friends appeared there after the landing) needed to take a connection to Paris to go somewhere in the middle East.\n\n\\- And then I remember vividly talking to my mother, who passed away last year to cancer. It's the first time that I remember dreaming of her since then (again, I almost never remember my dreams). I remember being fully convinced that she was there alive, talking to me, and I was completely confused about why we had a funeral, since she was obviously alive and well.\n\nIn a weird way, it didn't feel like a dream. Feels like I was actually talking to her, and that she's out there somewhere.\n\nThe fact that this all happened during a fool moon makes this even stranger. I don't know what to make of it all, whether it's related or not. I just felt like I had to write it down, just to make sure I remember that this happened.\n\nedit: I just realized that in 4 days, it will be exactly 1 year since she passed.

For some context, I am very spiritual and my dream involved some kind of spell/ritual.\n\nAll I remember is that me and my mother got into some kind of argument and I ended up going to the store to get something. At the store, I met an older lady who was also spiritual and near the check out lanes she showed me this spell/ritual that could help me with what I was going through (I think it was I could set an intention/make a wish of some kind). I don't recall how she knew I needed help or why this started but she showed me how to do the spell/ritual: I would have to find a gathering of ants, find the queen, and spread sulfur on top of her and around the other ants. I remember hearing so clearly the ants eating the sulfur and I think their queen (not 100% sure on the queen being eaten though). Then she had me take my own hair and for some reason I didn't take the hair from my head rather I had a bundle of hair from when I was blonde and it was fried and crunchy like it had been when I went blonde -- she took the hair, had me set my intention of what I wanted out of the experience, and sprinkled the hair on top of the ants and they started chewing at it. I remember my intention being something along the lines of wanting to find my authentic self and feel comfortable with who I am. I ended up crying (in the dream and in real life because I'm very physically reactive while I'm sleeping) and my mom appeared angry and we argued while I cried. I felt like my chest was constricting, like something had been unlocked and was now suffocating me. That's when I woke up.\n\nI don't know if this is just some weird dream I had but because of my spirituality, I'm inclined to believe this might mean something more because of how much its effecting me emotionally in my waking life. Anyone have any ideas of what this might mean??"

In real life me and this person could probably never be friends again due to what they did. But it feels like my subconscious is telling me different.

    "body": "The dream started with me talking to this girl from work, she was telling me about how I should throw a party. Then I remember driving home at night and seeing like 100 people outside my house, waiting to be let in. I thought \"wtf\" in the back of my mind. I then make my way through the crowd to the front door. I remember saying something along the lines of \"Do not slam into each other and break stuff, and \"if you f\\*ck with my dogs, I will beat the sh\\*t out of you\" \n\n(I've never actually \"beaten the sh\\*t out of anyone\" but if I see someone hurting an animal that would change). \n\nSo I unlock the door and walk inside. The first thing I noticed was the sound of the microwave being on. I walk into the kitchen and see that there is food in it and it's been heating it. At this point I like recalled putting it in there before leaving that morning (I didn't actually dream that part). But it had like 6 number slots instead of the usual 3 so my guess is that I added too many zeros when I put it in. \n\nAnother thing I noticed was a TON of bubbles all over the floor outside the kitchen. I followed the bubbles and realized it was coming from my dog's room (they have their own room). I instantly panicked and opened their door. They were in there submerged in the bubbles. There was some kind of pressure washing thing that had been on that was producing the bubbles. I turned it off and noticed how easy the button was to trigger. I surmised that someone left it on the floor and the dogs bumped it and it turned on. \n\nI pulled the dogs out of the bubbles. My beagle had shrank by like 50% and he looked SO SAD. I gave him a hug and inspected my other 2 dogs. They were seemingly fine. \n\nThe next thing I remember, I was in the basement listening to some band playing. There were tons of people. This security guard kept coming up to me and talking to me and I'd jump down from the ledge and accidentally land on his shoes every time. He wasn't talking to me about anything bad I was doing though. I'm guessing my dream self had hired him because he was reporting stuff to me. \n\nThe last time he talked to me he said something along the lines of \"Hey you need to come with me man, someone is trying to diss you\" (I don't think I've ever actually used the word \"diss\" so idk). Oh and he also told me to stop stepping on his shoes every time he talked to me.\n\nAs we walked up stairs he explained what he meant. He said that some people of the party claimed I would pay for anything, so they all went out to get food for themselves. Like they knew that's not what I meant and they tried it anyways. \n\nI went looking around the party and noticed all the people I actually knew were absorbed into their own groups and having fun. I felt kind of sad by this because I had been standing alone in the basement. I felt abandoned in a way, if that makes sense. I thought at least surely the friend from work would hang out with me but no.\n\n As I walked around, only one person acknowledged me. They patted me on the back as I walked by. The weirdest thing is that I think it was myself. Like a separate me. I didn't take an active look at them but I did notice they were wearing a shirt that I wear a lot IRL. \n\nI made my way over to a makeshift bar. The seats were all full. I looked at the bartenders and they were talking about how something had finally arrived. One of them then excitedly held up what I think was a $3 bill. (yes I know that's not a real thing but still). I woke up pretty much after that. \n\n\\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHonestly as I was typing this out I found some meaning in it. I think it related to my fears of being alone. The other night I had a dream that I was at work and everyone was a different person except 2. One of those 2 being the same girl from the post dream. The 2 who were the same were both telling me that they're leaving. And I was so scared of being the only one left. That everyone I knew was replaced. \n\nI feel like the post dream ties into that a lot. That I feel like there is nothing about me that people want to experience. So I'm always witnessing the conversations but never a part of them. \n\nAnd maybe I should just forget all of them because the only person who noticed me was quite possibly myself. Aside from the cool security guard."

Even during nightmares I can tell they're dreams.\n- no one, not even people I know IRL, have faces in any of my dreams, ever. I just know who they are. \n- I do tend to remember dreams, but not with this clarity. \n\nA few months ago I had a dream that started with me walking down a long hallway and opening a MASSIVE door. It was black but incredibly intricate. I met a few people (none of which had faces), and somehow got into an altercation with a couple of men. This....stunning \"person\" saved me. I could clearly see his face, and there was nothing remarkable about his features, he just radiated power. When I asked his name, he simply said \"Death\". We spent some time together and fell in love. He was incredibly kind, gentle, loving, protective, etc etc. He eventually revealed his \"true\" form to me. Intimidating, powerful, but not horror movie scary. And not the grim reaper. After revealing himself to me he cupped my face in his massive hands and said \"you are the embodiment of life. We have always co-existed, but I would like to continue the rest of eternity with you bringing life to my heart as well\". \nI haven't been able to stop thinking about that dream. I can remember every detail, down to how his hands felt on my face. Last night, I had what seemed to be a continuation of that dream. I opened that door again, and he was there waiting for me. He didn't bother with his human form this time, and he felt so warm and alive. The opposite of what I'd expect \"Death\" to feel like. He held me like I was made of glass and said that my presence made his necessary, but he was eternally grateful for having been created because it meant he met me. He kissed me, said he would see me soon, and then I woke up. I could feel his lips against mine for a few seconds after I woke up. \n\nI frequently have really strange dreams (even involving zombies \"procreating\"). This takes the cake though.

(Imagine the shots in the marvelous misadventures of flapjack where it‚Äôs super close up and detailed lol)"

    "body": "I had this dream some time ago. It felt significant somehow and I still sometimes think back and wonder what it means. So hoping someone can help me understand it a bit. \n\nI'm sitting on my bed which is much bigger than it is in reality (probably king size while at the time I had a single bed). There are many small and cute yellow chicks on my bed around me. There is also an older, bit bigger chick around that is swallowing the small ones and throwing them up again. It feels like new chicks are being born that way. With the throwing up of the chicks, some slime lands on the white bed sheets everywhere. In the beginning if feels ok, but after a while I feel that I should clean it up. I go looking for new sheets, a stain remover or checking if the washing machine is free but I cannot really resolve it or find a solution. I end up feeling embarrassed and slightly ashamed. \n\nSome context: I'm a 31 y/o female, have been doing therapy for a while to work on the relationship to my parents. At that time, I was with my boyfriend for approx. 6 months and we started thinking about moving in together. \n\nGrateful for any suggestions on what this may mean!"

First i was driving a car that i couldnt quite control because of how big the car was but i was able to do it without any crashing. Then it switched to me being in an apartment that switched into a house. Then the house started flying off and we (cant recall who was in the house at the time) had to direct it away from a really bad storm. Which we did successfully. Then the dream switched to me adopting a 2nd cat. From there i woke up and when i went back to sleep I was watching King (from the owl house) trapped on an elevator that wanted to torture him but he got out (i know that part's really random).

I met this guy 3 months ago saw him 5 times only we‚Äôve chatting but nothing serious, i am not really attracted to him, and I don‚Äôt think about him that much tbh. But suddenly I started dreaming about him - the thing is I don‚Äôt usually dream about people, even the ones that i truly desire-. In the dream he was inside a cubic rectangle and running in circles, it felt as if he is trapped and i felt worried and annoyed af cuz why circular inside a rectangle?!! , and not being able to help him , and he looked frustrated ! \nI had a second dream about him too, which was even weirder, the dream was that he got engaged to a very very hot girl, i was not jealous but what annoyed me in the dream was that everyone keeps saying that i don‚Äôt have a mom and they are all tip-toeing and worried around me including him. ( i do have a mom irl) the guy did not seem quite happy about the engagement, it felt like he is doing it bcz natural order of life steps even tho the girl he got engaged to was ecstatic and hot. And i kept wandering why is he not happy? And why he keeps being concerned about me?\nWhat could that mean ? \nCurrently i am in talking stage with him and it‚Äôs a bit dry cuz he is not a chat person nor am i, so it‚Äôs been slow and little awkward, he likes me for sure- he didn‚Äôt say it but I can sense it- i am not sure how i feel about him tho."

    "body": "I know this all sounds concocted but I wrote these as soon as I could after waking up.\n\nIt's long and detailed. I had to sit and think about it over and over before grabbing my laptop.\n\n4 June 2023\n\r\nParts of the dream are separated in ‚Äúphases‚Äù because there are cuts in my dreams. Not\r\nentirely sure if it is normal for the dream sequence to randomly just act up and the things you\r\nsee change. It‚Äôs like skipping scenes in films. So I will be writing things as I saw them, and\r\ntrust that I tried very hard to recollect every detail. Some may have just been added to fill in\r\nthe gaps but this is the overall drift I get from the dream.\n\r\nPhase One\n\r\nI was working on a cruise ship, a peculiar job for me. Certain tasks included getting tickets\r\nfrom a machine as part of a security measure. It seemed mundane until we found out that\r\nthe tickets were somehow compromised and falsified, thus all the data we have been\r\ninputting somewhere were incorrect. There had been a breach and our supervisor is trying to\r\nfigure out who had done it and what would be the consequences of the error.\n\r\nNeedless to say, it is impossible to discern what kind of job this actually is and what the\r\npurpose of all that is.\n\r\nHowever, it came to pass that I was working alongside my mother. We were together for the\r\nfinal task, and she tells me to get a ticket before we get on a platform atop the room we were\r\nin. It looks more like an escape vent that leads outside the ship. Knowing the ticket machine\r\nis unreliable, I simply said no and went ahead to the surface without her. The ship starts to\r\nsink and the room fills with water. She makes it out alright.\n\r\nPhase Two\n\r\nIt appears we live in a ferry boat, and I planned on moving out. My mother and I, just like in\r\nreal life, have a tumultuous relationship in my dream. My little brother in the middle of the\r\nchaos between us, is unable to choose sides but sticks with mother. I was off the boat for a\r\nwhile and discussing what I want my future to be like with my boyfriend. Later, I proceed to\r\ngo back to the boat and pack my things. I needed to time it to when mother is not around to\r\navoid further conflict. Alas, she was around and I was unaware, so there was a lot of\r\nbickering. I could see the hatred in both of our faces.\n\r\nWhile I was leaving, my little brother approaches me and apologises on mother‚Äôs behalf. He\r\ntells me she doesn‚Äôt mean any of the cruel things she said towards me. I invite him to move\r\nout with me so he can have a more peaceful life. Again, he is unable to decide.\r\nHe was involved in a contest of sorts held by a university, and the event was held in the\r\nboats docked at the marina. This event took place before I planned on moving out. My\r\nbrother won the contest (I really do not know what it is though) and having found out about\r\nthis I was proud of him, as well as cheered him on. He is indeed gifted. The prize would have\r\nbeen a generous amount of money, but the university held back on the winnings. They\r\nrefused to give it to my brother, had both mother and brother sign a non-disclosure\r\nagreement, as well as threatened their lives if they ever spoke about the winnings not being\r\ngiven.\n\nThey are under duress, and every time there would be a little bit of interaction between my\r\nfamily and other people from the outside, they are being watched closely by the\r\norganisation. I suddenly have a vision that makes my heart sink, but the reason for this\r\nemotion is unclear. The vision was fireworks at the marina. Seems harmless.\r\nA celebration of sorts was held at the marina later on. My boyfriend and I were watching\r\nfrom the hill overlooking the docks, and there it was. A fireworks display. An explosion\r\nhappens minutes after and the ferry boat we lived on is sinking. My brother barely makes it\r\nout alive, mother is nowhere to be found. I assume the worst.\r\nMy boyfriend and I try to take my brother to safety, we are driving to someplace. But a freak\r\naccident happens and we lose him. Distraught, I begin to consult with authorities to\r\ninvestigate everything that has happened so far. The boats, the accident, the university‚Äôs\r\nwithholding of funds from winners.\n\r\nPhase Three\n\r\nI am no longer present in the next scenes, staff workers from neighbouring boats at the\r\nmarina talk about the events. One of the cooks/kitchen staff members began to disclose the\r\nsecrets of the university (about them withholding the funds to winners and the threats). She\r\nsays some of the eventgoers were silenced about an incident regarding a cake. This mystery\r\ncake contained something that did not belong there. She was encouraged to pass the\r\ninformation over to investigating authorities. She expressed she would rather take a look at\r\nthe cake, as she heard it was hidden somewhere in one of the docked boats.\r\nThey go onto the boat where the main event was held and after a thorough but discreet\r\nsearch, they find the cake. Covered in cloth. After having lifted the cloth, they see what\r\nappears to be a normal cake. Plain chocolate cake. No frostings, no toppings. Just round\r\nchocolate bread. Some of them start cutting slices and help themselves with the cake. But\r\nthe more they cut, the more they find there is something strange about it. One last slice,\r\nacross the entire cake, cutting it in half, reveals it contains some parts of a dismembered\r\ninfant. Unfortunately, before this reveal, some of them have already consumed bits of this\r\nmonstrosity. So they gag and retch. One of the cooks grins for some reason.\n\r\nLast Phase\n\r\nThe culprit is among the kitchen staff present in the previous scene. He is shown throwing a\r\nbaby into a sink filled with boiling water. I could hear this baby cry bloody murder.\n\r\nAnd then I woke up disturbed, perhaps traumatised by the nightmare.\n\nInterpretation welcome and in fact, invited. I appreciate any help understanding this dream. I am not at all taken aback by how vivid my dreams are, cause they often are and I'm used to it. I have already made a habit of dream journaling, but I am not good at interpreting my own dreams."

I am in bed and become aware of someone scraping irregular shapes into my lower back. My back is incredibly sensitive so this starts out uncomfortable but becomes painful. I twitch away and the talon follows a moment later, just when I'm starting to relax. Eventually I realize my tormentor is an old hag with a disfigured face, as though she was wearing a person suit and someone ripped the bottom half of the face off, revealing green skin and oddly shaped teeth. \nI know what's going to happen next and though I beg her to leave me alone and try to crawl away, my attempts grant me no relief or real distance. She sinks her teeth into my lower back, biting again each time I move. Again I feel it on my body and shift in my actual bed but it takes a long time to wake up and get enough distance from the dream that I don't immediately fall back into it. There were points in the nightmare where she looked or acted like my male fiance, but only out of the corner of my eye, never when I looked at her full on.\n\nI've had similar nightmares, where I tell people no or stop and they don't listen. I suppose it has to deal with not feeling like I have any say in what happens to me, or just in general in life. But I'm not sure why this one keeps coming back. Why an old hag? Why the biting and scratching?"

At the station, I was rapidly approached by strangers each speaking a different language. Some I could understand, while some were very different.

Right as we are about to drive out of the clearing and back into the dense forest there is a blinding flash of white light, panic immediately floods my body.

    "body": "[this is a crosspost from r/Dreams] \n\nHi r/DreamInterpretation, I think I need help figuring this one out because I've had basically the same dream at least three times now. Which is really weird since I rarely ever remember my dreams.\n\nFor some context, my dog died on December 27th, so relatively recently. She was a sweet old girlie with a lot of health problems, it was her time. I loved her with all my heart and since I'm on the younger side (and very forgetful) I barely have any memories of life without her in it. That's caused some weirdness in the grieving process, since I'm sort of stuck within the denial phase since I have to rewrite my concept of home life without my dog in it.\n\nAnyways, over the past month or so I've had this weird dream about my dog a few times. The \"plot\" of what happens in the dream is pretty straightforward, with me mostly just doing normal stuff around the house, though not interacting with my parents much (we live in the same house).\n\nThe weird part is that for some reason, my parents bought/adopted multiple copies of the same dog, specifically my dead dog. The copies are slightly off from the real one visually in coloring, but I don't think that matters. \n\nAll of these doggie clones act and look exactly like my dead dog did, they just end up doing different things at different times. The number of dogs in the dreams fluctuates constantly, the lowest I remember being 3 and the highest being around 13. And this isn't just a weird dream quirk, \"dream-me\" actually reacts to the fact that the number of dogs is constantly changing which is really friggin weird.\n\nIn fact, \"dream-me\" seems to be fully aware that none of this was normal, and I feel really vaguely unsettled throughout the dream. Just that weird, distant \"something is fundamentally wrong with this\" feeling that you get sometimes. Other than that distant feeling, \"dream-me\" is usually pretty comforted by the fact that I'm surrounded by a bunch of sweet, sleepy puppers throughout my day.\n\nHowever, \"dream-me\" did approach my parents about the weirdness of the situation a couple times, to which (I think) either they didn't respond at all or just dismissed it like it was normal or something.\n\nOther parts that might be somewhat relevant:\n- If I remember correctly, \"dream-me\" may be aware that the real dog is singular, and is dead\n- All the colors in the dream are muted to greyscale (or close to it, with light yellowish tints instead)\n- My house in the dream is somewhat different, looking more like an extended version of my poorly designed basement than the real thing\n\nI would really appreciate help in deciphering what the hell any of this means. The closest things that I can possibly glean from it would be\n1. I'm not over it (yeah probably)\n2. My subconscious thinks my parents aren't over it and are trying to replace my dog (maybe???)\n3. My subconscious wants me and my parents to know that my dog cannot effectively be replaced, it would feel wrong (possibly???)\n\nSo yeah thanks for reading through this weird clone-dog dream.\n\nTL;DR: My dog died and now I'm getting recurring dreams about sharing a house with 3-13 clones of her, what the hell does that mean"

He felt like the angry disagreeable guy and I felt more like the quiet calm person. He found me a good person that he felt calmer when he was with me. He even protected me when other alpha guys were trying to insult me. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI was wondering what this dream meant BTW I am not an fan of andrew tate for those who wonder."

    "body": "I (36f) dreamed I was a bridesmaid in two weddings that were happening on the same day. I went to the bridal shop the day before the weddings to pick up my dresses. One wedding was for my mom (she's been happily single and not dating for like 10 years) and the dress was a black skirt bottom but the top was a very revealing bejeweled/rhinestone string bikini. Very NOT my mom lol, and I was also supposed to pick out matching jewelry and buy enough sets for my sisters to have some also. The lady helping me could not find the second dress which was supposed to be for my college best friend's wedding. I was maid of honor for her real wedding 15 years ago lol, but since covid our friendship has really tapered off and I haven't talked to her in a while. So in the dream I started panicking and searching through the storage area and eventually the whole store trying to find this missing bridesmaid dress. That one was supposed to be a very traditional looking dress but in black. So I have one black bridesmaid dress I'm very iffy about and I'm frantically searching for another more traditional but also black bridesmaid dress. The two weddings were happening the next day, my mom's in the morning and my friend's in the evening. I didn't seem stressed about the timing, just about the dresses. Also my mom is unlikely to remarry and my friend is already happily married. Just an all around weird and stressful dream.\n\nA side note about weddings/marriage is that my husband I divorced last year but we reconciled and have recently been discussing getting remarried. I'm thinking there is a deeper connection here to that idea."

I spent the dream trying to walk back home and of course, woke up long before I could reach it.\n\nIn another I think I was coming out the back of a school building late at night and behind it was a large parking lot. I don't remember getting into a car or anything but I think it was one of those \"far from home\" dreams.\n\nIn yet another, more recent one, I was trying to exit the back of a school building, but the catch was there was no solid road outside and there was quite a drop down from the door. I'm guessing it was near some kind of train track field or something, maybe even right on top of it. \n\nAnyway in this dream my old technology teacher from high school was the one driving me home.

    "body": "TLDR at the end.\n\nThe earliest I can remember in the dream was going to this huge house for a get together with friends from a new church that invited me. The house had a large TV, a very spacious living room, a line of doors north the living room that lead to another part of the house, stairs on the east of the room that lead to the outside patio, three doorways southwest of the house the lead to three rooms each with a large stain glassed window of Jesus, and to the west of the house was a kitchen that had large stairs that lead up. In this house, there were about 8 girls around my age, a medium sized dog, and a man in his late 20s - early 30s with his wife and a buddy of his. The couple and his friend decided to leave the house for some reason and I was left alone in this house with the girls and the dog. At some point, I accidentally hurt the dog (not badly though, just made him yelp) and one of the girls grabbed the dog and yelled, \"I hope you never do that again. If you do that again I'll kill you. I'll kill your right here.\" In a fit of rage I screamed back, \"Well I hope you do. I HOPE YOU DO FUCKING KILL ME!\" At that moment I grabbed some of my things and ran up the stairs, however I was still missing my backpack. I looked behind me and saw the girl angrily grab an empty bottle of svedka and march up the stairs after me as I hurriedly fiddled with the shitty doorknob to the outside patio. Once I got out there the patio was mostly covered in smooth gravel with the occasional concrete squares and a metal grater close to the door that was falling in. I stood outside of the door as the girl who I pissed off as well as the other girls started throwing glass bottles at me and everyone of them missed me and shattered behind me. They were shouting at me as I was trying to explain to them that all I needed was my backpack and I would leave. A girl with blonde wavy hair walked out of the house and started shoving me and pushing her glass bottle into my arm and chest. At that moment, I realized that her pushes felt like nothing and a voice inside my head said \"You're dreaming\". I forcefully pushed her away and looked at the ground while I did it then looked back up only to realize the blonde girl disappeared. I looked back over at the door to see the girls staring back at me then shutting the door. I walked back into the house with the girls nowhere to be found and the dog peacefully sleeping on the floor. I walked back down the stairs and once I reached the bottom I noticed one of the girls peaking from behind one of the lines of doors from the north side of the room then slowly closing it. I realized now would be a good time to find my backpack and head home. This was when I looked into the different doorways that lead to the rooms with the stain glassed windows and thought, \"Damn, this house is huge.\" I walked into the kitchen only to be welcomed by the man and his wife and friend walking through one of the doors that lead outside. I told him about the backpack situation and he said I would get it back after the church service and lead me up the stairs in the kitchen and it was at that moment I realized I was shirtless. I covered my breasts with my arms and walked up the stairs to a huge chapel full of people. I sat down for a few moments then decided to just leave and maybe come back later once i was dressed. Once I got home and put a shirt on I noticed how absolutely filthy my room was. There were yellow and white stains on the carpet, the windows were covered in condensation on the inside, and both of my pet's tanks (I have am axolotl and a hamster) were disgusting. I also noticed that my axolotl's bubbler was on in his tank and half the water was gone. I quickly unplugged it then stared out the window because I noticed my mom's suitcase on the floor and she was nowhere to be found so u assumed she'd be coming home soon. I first saw a woman I didn't know walk up the stairs to my house and knocked on the door and stood there then I saw my mom. I turned around only to see her already walking up the stairs to my room and I explained the situation with the bubbler. She replied, \" oh its good for him\" to which I said, \"no, if you leave it on too long it stresses him out.\" I looked away and looked back only to see the bubbler on again and my axolotl vomiting became of it. Once again I turned it off and said \"Keep it off, I mean it.\" \"Oh, he likes it.\" \"I MEAN IT!\" Just then mom let out my old family dog who died 2 years ago. Her fur was completely white when it was usually brown and black and she could barely walk. She fell to the floor and started vomiting profusely with the occasional human-sounding burp in between gagging. Then I woke up. It was the craziest thing I ever dreamt.\n\nTLDR:\nI went to a big church house that housed 8 girls and a dog. I hurt the dog and the girls got mad and fought me. I realized I was dreaming when I didn't feel them hurt me. They ran off and spied on me in the house when I went looking for my backpack. The man who owned the house returned with his wife and I realized I was naked at this point. He told me I would get my backpack back if I went to a church service. I went home instead to put on some clothes. At home my room was filthy and my pets were sick. I got into an argument with my mom over it."

    "body": "Hi guys, I have been able to lucid dream for as long as i‚Äôve been able to remember‚Ä¶ it has never been something that i need to ‚Äútry‚Äù to do. in fact, i thought it was normal to be able to control your dreams each time you slept until my young friends told me otherwise. Not to trauma dump, but for context, I did not have the best of childhoods, and i genuinely think that my ability to control my dreams came from a subconscious need to control my real life. Usually in lucid dreams, I am able to completely take over. However recently, it has been harder for me to have complete control. I am aware that I am dreaming and actively trying to take control, but it‚Äôs like my subconscious is against me‚Ä¶ the best example is me and mirrors. Every time i pass a mirror, I am unwittingly enthralled by it. I stare at it for long amounts of time until my image becomes distorted. As i stare ahead straight faced, my reflection taunts me with a sadistic smile, inviting me to enter the mirror. Just like you see in the movies, I dip my finger and the mirror ripples, I am allowed to enter it. Each time i stick my head in, I see a world completely mirrored from the one dream me is currently in, with a dark blue tint. It feels cold and threatening. I pull my head out and continue on doing what I usually do (which is generally being the scarlet witch and fucking up my abusers with red squiggly doos) I was just wondering if any other fellow lucid dreamers have experienced something similar? it‚Äôs like one of the only things i unwillingly do in my dreams and i‚Äôd really like to know any type of theories you may have :)"

After talking to a friend who doesn‚Äôt believe in dream interpretation, he said he feels like there is a meaning behind it and was actually interested in knowing all the details. \n\nSo the dream started out in a village. It was a small country area and there were like invisible walls around the town, no one came in, no one left. Except for the train that passed by. I was in arranged marriage by the heads of the town to this woman who was pregnant. She didn‚Äôt want to be married to me, but as ordered by the town we had to stick together. We were married because the single folk in the town were often murdered or targeted for crimes. As I was a visitor, it was safer to be married. There was murder, arson, thievery, it was plaguing the city. My wife and I arranged that we live together and I would help with the baby. I would go to work, turning a side eye to the people who were becoming victims to others crimes. I worked with this man that was awfully close to my wife and he would talk about my wife, giving me the sense he was the father to the unborn child. \n\nReturning to our house I told her it was a bad idea to show public affection especially around the travelers that caused chaos in the town. She wasn‚Äôt having it, she didn‚Äôt want my help no matter how much I tried. Eventually we made our way to a town meeting outside the train tracks. The mayor wanted to prevent travelers from entering the town if they mean harm, I turned to my wife to grab her hand but the mayor was killed.

As I‚Äôm walking out of the school, I get pulled into a modeling course, I meet very beautiful women and we model dresses.. then I feel weird and walk out of the room. \n\nIn the hall a siren goes off, I try to run because I think it‚Äôs a fire siren, but then a girl next to me shouts to get down because it‚Äôs a earthquake siren.\nA younger girl next to me it‚Äôs struggling so I try my best to use my body to shelter her as the world around us shakes. \n\nAfter the quake I run out as fast as I can to find my car.  \n\n\nThat‚Äôs all.\n\nHow did I lose control?\nWhy does this green tower always appear?\nWhy do bathrooms have some weird appearance with the tower, in my dreams?"

I saw my sister, and she noticed what I was doing. There was also a teacher nearby (I forgot her name), and they saw what was happening. They happened to walk by at the perfect time, so they heard me tell the bully, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt ever bully me again. If you do, I‚Äôll make your life a living hell‚Äù (not sure where that came from). So rather than getting angry at me, they joined in (standing up to bully). In this dream, I was also androgynous? I was still me, but different than I usually look.

When I sleep in my room here I have some pretty scary nightmares that are usually lucid, and end with sleep paralysis. I don't get that when I sleep anywhere else though. But, here's the dream (I \"wake up\" multiple times but at no point was I actually awake):\nI was downstairs in my room and my mom came down and got upset at me about something and then walked back upstairs and I just went back to sleep then I woke up again and I had anxiety and asked her to sit with me, and she told me that we are going to New York this weekend for my birthday and I said I can't because I have to work.\nI then started to realize that I was dreaming and as soon as I did I was teleport to a dark street next to a pier, where a smaller creature (looked like Doby from Harry Potter kinda) was waiting for me and it basically said that he has been waiting for me and will kill me. Then it got even darker and I saw dark figures slicing through the darkness around me, until they started to strike me with glancing blows. When I started trying to fight back the small creature said \"vou will never win like this is not a fight of physical power but a war within the mind\" so I took a deep breath and began to explode the monsters and with my hits they would explode with a little bit of light. after I killed all of them i walked to the little creature and put my hands on his head and watched him explode lighting up the street in golden hour light. then woke up in my bed(not realizing in my dream my room was not correctly set up) and went upstairs to see my family who was all in the living room, packed and ready for New York telling me it was time to go.\n\nI just woke up and wrote this it is now about 3 and I woke up from this an hour ago.\n\nI really hope someone is able to bring some interpretation to this and I‚Äôm interested in what people think it could mean.

( I don‚Äôt think she had the heart to just straight up do it, she had to fall into the wall and force herself into it. )\r  \nI open the door quick and inquisitive; she perks up and try‚Äôs to hide what she just did. thinking a smile will make the cause for concern go away. \r  \nBLACKOUT ( A FUCKIN GAIN I awake. ---- as before i know there is still more. ) I fall back asleep.\r  \nNow were walking down the street all of us. Twilight is beginning . the brunettes are in front. im in the middle and the blonde is behind me a couple feet apart. The brunettes stop in their tracks with maps trying to assess where to go. so they stop. I stop just short of them. The blonde bumps into me because she didn‚Äôt notice. I can see her. Her eyes still amazingly silver but they‚Äôre filled with tears and pain, she‚Äôs wincing. \r  \nI approach and say. ‚Äúbreathe ( gesturing nose first and out the mouth) you need to breathe. Do it with me‚Äù (still gesturing) and the brunettes surround the blonde and I, in a hugging circle, and they‚Äôre helping to get her breathing under control. She‚Äôs got it down and it has seemed to work.\r  \nThen the blonde comes in to me and kisses me. THE most passionate kiss I have ever had (topping real life experiences) this lasted about 10-15 seconds. \r  \nI Awake. And I cant go back and see the rest of this out because I awoke 7 minutes before my alarm.\r  \nIt pains me that I cant. I just don‚Äôt understand any of it, but I want back in."

    "body": "So, just as I fell asleep I remember getting out of a car with a person whose face I do not remember very well. We were getting out of a car which had stopped at the edge of a forest, and for some reason we decided to wander in.\r  \n\r  \nWe walked for a decent amount of time until the weather started to get cloudy, and the enviroment got darker and more eerie... Suddenly, we got scared by a loud noise coming from all directions; we look up and see some kind of dark giants with very slender and large limbs, a very flat body and a square head with some kind of antenna or something sticking out at the top of their head (almost like a square building with an antenna).\r  \n\r  \nThere were a lot of those things, so we decided to run as fast as we could to a place with more trees in hopes that they couldn't see us anymore, but after some minutes of running, we encountered a simple house, which was in the middle of a decently-large portion of grass with no trees surrounding it. We ran towards it to get away from the dark giants looming in the forest, and surprisingly, we got in the house with no complications...\r  \n\r  \nInside, a couple of old ladies told us that they welcomed us, and that they were sorry for all we went through, apparently they had some kind of magic wand / rod / stick which made wonders for them and it controlled everything in the forest. They told us that they could even create people with the stick and controll them to do their bidding, but unfortunately some had defects and had to be killed. \r  \n\r  \nThe old ladies told us that we were allowed to wander around the house, as long as we wouldn't go too deep in it. I wondered what they meant until I looked back: this simple and small house was suddenly a humongous labyrinth in which all rooms seemed similar, and yet, different from each other.\r  \n\r  \nWe walked through the house for a while and talked about the stick that supposedly controlled everything. We decided to break it, because we thought that these old ladies were doing something that was morally wrong, although right now as I'm typing this I'm still wondering if that was the right thing to do...\r  \n\r  \nWe found ourselves in a room with the stick resting above a silver plate just as we were finished talking, so I went over to it, grabbed it and snapped it in two with my hands. It felt like snapping a twig in a park. Suddenly afterwards, we heard a loud noise coming from outside, and through a window we saw that the giants were starting to collapse and fall, and the house was suddenly filled with the screams of the old ladies.\r  \n\r  \n\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!\" Was all we could hear, along with some screams which we didn't know if were made because of anger, fear, pain or a mixture of all.\r  \n\r  \nA door appeared beside us, and we went through it to get out of the house. It was still cloudy, but the enviroment regained a bit of its colour back now that the giants were falling. We didn't care for it, though, as we only cared for getting out of there as fast as possible.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we thought we were getting closer to the edge of the forest, from where everything had started, my companion looked back and asked me if I remember what the old ladies said. When I asked them about what they meant, they said that the old ladies affirmed that they could control other people to do what they wanted. I nodded, and my companion pointed back in resonse to my answer.\r  \n\r  \nJust as I turned around I screamed, a man I had never seen before was up in my face with a crazed look in his eyes. It was almost as if he wasn't a man anymore, but rather a fierce animal who had lost all trace of humanity.\r  \n\r  \nHe grabbed me by my shirt with one hand and pulled out a knife with the other. Just as he was stabbing me I woke up, sweating lightly and my legs shaking even though I wasn't standing.\r  \n\r  \nThis happened just today... What does this mean? Did I get suggested by something?"

My boyfriend is there with me and we are trying to find privacy to have sex. We find a room that is like a shed, there is steam\nComing from a nearby hose in the wall and gravel on the ground. We begin kissing and the gravel or broken glass gets in my mouth. I try to pick it out - I want to give my boyfriend head but the gravel or broken glass is in my mouth. It occurs to me that the air or the entire site is probably toxic - due to its nature of being an old industrial site. \n\nNext scene - it is bedtime and my boyfriend is putting my son to bed (common in my waking life).\nMy son won‚Äôt sleep, I open a floor level window while holding him. Outside the window, there is a row of evening spaces faves with a small flower in each. Someone is parked in front of the window with two small children sitting on the side walk. I reach to open the window and it knocks the small vase and the water spills on the sidewalk wetting the children. They begin to cry. I call for someone to bring towels and for help. My son slowly slips from my arms through the open window and bumps the back of his head - it‚Äôs a very small fall maybe 3 inches. \n\nI am concerned, and carry him back to the bed - he seems asleep but I am worried about a brain bleed from the bump. My mom and aunt are there - I consult with them. They say he is fine but I can see his eyes flickering as if he is about to convulse. His face begins changing and I know he is not well. He transforms into an aggressive version of himself - like\nChucky. he keep trying to attack me. I block his attacks with nearby objects - which he smashes with his fists. When he charges at me I pick him up from his arm and set him down on furniture. This happens several\nTime. Someone nearby lifts a large piece of wood or a wooden toy to hit him and I yell for the person to stop - ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hurt him.‚Äù I call out to those around me - ‚Äúcall 911, please google to see if a bump on the head causes aggressiveness.‚Äù I decide to try and corral him by playing a game and telling Conor he is a monster I need to catch. It seems to focus his energy on me - it feels dark and evil. I finally grab him and he becomes an empty box in my hands - like a flattened happy meal box. I wake up screaming, ‚ÄúI have the monster.‚Äù\n\nObservation - writing this  dream down causes me sob \nFeelings upon waking - terror, grief,\nConfusion and helplessness because no one would help me in my dream\n\nEvents leading up - three days before fought with my BFF bc she has been gossiping about me and I felt unwelcome at her house during a visit. Night before dream - boyfriend upset with me over what I perceive to be a minor issue."

Those are what I see in front of the screen while she's doing the procedure.\n\nI have sensitive gums irl, and I tend to squirm a lot during prophylaxis, and the exact same thing happened to my dream until I felt a shooting pain but a huge chunk of plaque gets removed, molar still intact, and that's what woke me up from the dream.

Which number brings luck when playing lottery - lottery?** \n\nYou also know, with thousands of different dreams, with the dream of being pregnant being considered the most common. To better understand this dream, let Mu88 give a detailed answer in the specific article below.\r  \n\r  \n**How to interpret dreams of being pregnant?**\r  \nDreaming of pregnancy is a fairly common phenomenon and can be caused by many different reasons. Here are some common interpretations for this paranormal dream:\r  \n\r  \n**Delusions:** A common cause of pregnancy dreams is delusions. In dreams, we can imagine situations, landscapes, and events without reality. Therefore, the dream of being pregnant may just be an illusion that we create in our imagination.\r  \n\r  \n**Influence from reality:** Another possible cause is the influence of reality. If in our daily life we ‚Äã‚Äãare thinking or worrying about getting pregnant or preparing to get pregnant, then the pregnancy dream could be just a reflection of those thoughts.\r  \n\r  \n**Emotions:** Pregnancy dreams can also be a reflection of different emotions we are experiencing, like happiness, anxiety, or stress. Sometimes dreams can also indicate our desires, hopes or fears.\r  \n\r  \n\rIn summary, dreaming of pregnancy can be due to many different causes and there is not a single explanation for all cases. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon in the dream and has no effect on reality.\r  \n\r  \n**What does it mean to dream about being pregnant?**  \nThere is no one specific and common meaning for all pregnancy dreams. Each dream has its own message and meaning, which depends on many factors such as emotional state, the situation in the dream, memories and personal experiences of each person. Here are some meanings of dreams about good and bad things in your life:  \n**Dreaming about being pregnant**  \nDreaming of being pregnant is a very happy and joyful thing for women who are expecting children. However, this creates confusion for women planning without children or husbands. The dream that you are pregnant is usually a good omen, a happy and extremely lucky thing for women who are expecting children. In the coming days, your family life will be favorable and peaceful, because life is often full of luck and happiness.  \n**Dreaming that someone else is pregnant**  \nTo dream that an acquaintance is pregnant is the message that this dream wants to send to you that is to always be happy and live sincerely. Your relationship with your pregnant dream girlfriend is still very good, close, and close. Please try to save it.  \nSee more: [https://mu88.watch/mo-co-bau/](https://mu88.watch/mo-co-bau/)"

I remember someone saying they were glad they were owls and not vultures.\n\nI also remember driving a luxury SUV and a few of the \"pebbles\" got in the car as I was getting out to walk in the park. When I came back to the car, there were three full-sized barn owls in the car. I opened the passenger door and they flew off the edge of a cliff. They flew with such force... their wings generated so much wind. Only then did it seem like I could finally be free and move out of my mom's house. What on earth does this mean?\n\nEdit: It was also daytime in the dream. Barn owls are usually nocturnal, so not sure if that's significant."

    "body": "This is the second time this week I‚Äôve had a dream where I‚Äôm being chased to stalked by bears. I‚Äôve always had very vivid and almost psychic dreams, enough to where I used to keep a dream journal from all of the memories and stories I‚Äôd come up with- more than three in just one night. And the bear symbolism- could possibly be from the the Alaska hiking and camping videos that I watch at nighttime. But the context is different than the wholesome videos I watch. \n\nIn the first dream, I was being chased by two black bears around a playground. And then the next dream was me walking home from a convenience store and finding a black bear blocking my path home. They‚Äôve never attacked me (I‚Äôve always forced myself to wake up before they could) but their presence has been enough to intimidate me into attempting to run away or escape in some way. In my dreams, I‚Äôm never saved or rescued by anyone and so I wake up suddenly and in a panic."

    "body": "The first part of my dream I remember getting into this elevator with two other girls. As the door closed, we began to fall very fast. At first we thought the whole elevator was falling and we‚Äôd soon hit the bottom. We then realized that the top of of the elevator wasn‚Äôt moving at all. The bottom of the elevator had been a false bottom and we manage to grip on either side of the ‚Äúelevator walls‚Äù. We first tried climbing up but decided it‚Äôd be easier to climb down as long as we did not fall. It seemed to have gone on forever but when we reached the bottom, there was some sort of ramp. This was sort of mind boggling, because surely that fall would‚Äôve killed us and we would‚Äôve slid out at the bottom. We slowly slid out and found ourselves in some sort of factory. There were conveyor belts with packing boxes -just regular old cardboard boxes. \n\nI don‚Äôt remember much more, but the next part of the dream, we were stationed outside moving these large tubs - not the same as the packing boxes from before. There was a large building with two white folding tables and several large trucks surrounding the area. However there were a lot more women here and they are all quite young. There was an elder women yelling and ordering us to put the boxes under and on these tables, and to make sure they are sealed tightly before doing so. There was one with the top sitting on it with one corner of it being uncovered. A girl close by tripped into it and much faster than me and the other girls, she managed to grab onto the sides. I reached in to help pull her out. The lady began to yell and ask who left the box unsealed. A girl sepped forward to explain it was already unsealed and she was unsure of what to do. As the woman began to drag this girl away, I realized that this is very similar to what happened with the elevator, and I assumed all of these tubs contain endless holes, but don‚Äôt understand how. \n\nThe next part of the dream is a strange series of images and happenstances‚Ä¶ The one that sticks out to me the most is the image of a never ending staircase. I believe I have seen this illusion somewhere before, where someone seems to be running up a staircase that always leads back to the same place. But when the perspective is changed, the illusion breaks. I‚Äôve seen it in dreams before, and when I realize it the illusion breaks. Ive seen it in many different ways, but it seems like I see it all at once. One way is that u see the separation of the stairs, from beginning to end, sort of like a 3d model. Another way is as if I‚Äôm looking over the staircase into an abyss. The last way I watch as the person running on the stairs fall to their death‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt quite put these visuals into a specific place in my dream. They either occur before during or after the part I‚Äôm about to explain.\nThe next part of the dream, I am shackled to all the other women and we are walking up these stairs -not the same stairs I see in the visuals- I look up and see tattered wall paper and old portraits on the walls. The stairs have patterned carpet, and some of the flowers on the carpet have a shimmer to them. There are multiple staircases covered in these women, and the ceiling seems to be miles away. There are large men with face coverings guiding the women and belittling them.\n\nAt some point I have escaped these shackles and I‚Äôm running through these halls like I‚Äôm on a mission. I can see other people searching for me as I cause chaos throughout this mansion. I‚Äôm not sure what all I was doing to anger the people ‚Äúin charge‚Äù but the older woman is ordering the men previously mentioned to find me and sedate me. I realized that I can peel the wall back and sort of phase through to different rooms. When I do this it‚Äôs sort of wrapping myself into the wall like a blanket. This goes on forever and I can‚Äôt really explain all of the events that take place, but basically I‚Äôm traveling through the walls and I‚Äôm somewhat omniscient at this point. While running through a hallway, I run into a young man, he is much smaller than me he men previously mentioned. I realize I can take him with me when I go into the walls. As we phase in and out of the walls he gives me more information about what‚Äôs going on. We search the mansion to find more people who can be saved. However, I phase through a wall, and he does not come through with me. \n\nNow I gotta explain a reoccurring thing in my dreams to explain the last portion of this dream. This always occurs in different dreams, they never start the same. Something that is always the same though, is I‚Äôll walk into a room, and when I exit the room I‚Äôve entered what seems to be a completely different realm. I sort of glide across the floor here, and even float higher at times. This place is like a dark mysterious building but I can‚Äôt fully explain what it looks like. I can vividly see it in my mind, but it‚Äôs really weird. It‚Äôs sort of a collection of corridors, almost like a maze. The first time I had this happen I could hear a lot of voices telling me where to go and what to do, but the voices were conflicting with one another in what they were saying. The first time it took forever, but I end up at this ‚Äúwall‚Äù. This wall is a collection of colors and red beams. The colors are more like static, and the red beams bounce both back and forth and up and down. It is a very large wall, and I can‚Äôt decided if it‚Äôs safe to go through. I eventually decide there is nowhere else to go. I float upwards and through the wall, and once again everything has shifted. I‚Äôm sort of out of control in which way my body floats, and there are images and colors flying all around me. I‚Äôve had this happen in many dreams, but they seem to get closer and closer. The first reoccurrence was months after the first occurrence, and now I‚Äôve had it happen back to back. The first time it happened it took me forever to find this ‚Äúwall‚Äù and each time it seems to get easier and easier, like I just know where to go. In the dream I explained above, I immediately arrived at this ‚Äúwall‚Äù and went straight in. All the chaos started like normal, but I felt a sense of peace and maybe even control over this space."

I think the pretty vintage ones were really cheap and so I remember grabbing one and holding it close. It was overall very dark and a little creepy inside. And then I‚Äôm not sure why but I had a little brother waddling along too like maybe 4 years old (to clarify I only have an older brother who is an adult male) and I think someone who was supposed to be my mum. As we were about to exit the house I see little brother waddle behind an armchair and I lose sight of him, and then this weird wolf/beast looking thing walks towards me and says he‚Äôs gone now and that he‚Äôll replace him, if you say anything neither of you can leave and then the animal got all deformed and morphed into the exact body of my little brother and we walked out of the house‚Ä¶ does this have any significance?"

Then she was having us do this to other people or we would get tortured more. There was a group of friends that lived across the street. We went over there to ‚Äúmake friends ‚Äú so we could set them up to bring them back to her. They were not very nice people and they were making fun of me and the other girl. Idk who she was. One of the girls was pretty mean so we chose her as the like sacrifice. Then there was an alligator that was walking around when we got back to my grandmas house. For a minute there was a counter like a restaurant there where the girl came. The alligator was trying to get her and came in the house. It tried to bite me too even though I wasn‚Äôt the target. I went to the back of the house to hide from it and locked the door. I found a notebook with letters from people who were tortured and killed under a pillow on the bed. I read them and then the lady who was torturing had a husband that came. He turned her into the police and I was skeptical because why did he wait so long. Was he part of it the whole time?

The chairs were in a circular row and I was on the left side. There was a big projector. It was nighttime. The teacher was saying something and I remember giggling with a girl next to me about something. The teacher told me to please be quiet and said something else rude. I remember myself whispering to the girl next to me saying \"This bitch crazy.\" The teacher got furious and started yelling. I denied I said that to her. Then she threated to kill me and sexual assault me. I ran out the classroom and throughtout the whole dream, I was running from the teacher throughout the entire school. The school was huge, and in some instances I could see her chasing me, but then I'd disappear. Then, All I remeber is spending time in another room in the school with a bunch of students. I think I was having fun and was at peace. One of the studentss encouraged me to go back to classroom and apologize. She said her and a friend would come with me.

I used to sleep in the \"big bed\" with her until I was I guess like 5 or 6 years old. The nightmare was always like this: in my sleep, I woke up for something, I don't know I needed to drink or go to the bathroom, and I looked beside me to see my mother sleeping on her side giving me her back. So I got out of bed, did my things and went to the kitchen, where I would find my mother doing something like cooking and be like \"Oh you woke up\", leaving me with the question of who actually was sleeping beside me in the bed.\n\nI remember doing this dream all the time and be engulfed in a sense of complete dread and despair.\n\nNow I'm 30 years old and I'm having another recurring nightmare regarding my mother for the last couple of weeks. I find this peculiar because it's the second instance in my entire life in which I explicitly remember having the same nightmare more than once, and also so close to the first time, and this one is also about my mother (which, for context, is still alive and totally fine).\n\nI dream that we have a terrible fight, like screaming and berating one another in terrible ways, and then she dies. Not only she dies, she has an actual ictus right between my arms, like it's activated by her rage or her screaming. The dream is extremely brutal and graphic: I don't know how an ictus actually works, but her face basically melts in front of me, like half of it, while she screams something along the line \"Oh God I'm dying, I'm dying\". \n\nIt kinda impressed me. My mother's fine and while we don't agree all the time we're in a totally normal mother-son relationship and absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in the last few weeks or months. I'm also surprised that the only two recurring nightmare I've had in my life are 100% about her, but I guess that's pretty normal too I mean it's my mother."

Moreover, the dream foretells wealth, fame and happiness that is knocking on your door. Dreaming of fish predicts that you will inherit a huge fortune from your family. It is expected that with this money you do not have to do anything, you can live comfortably until the end of your life. However, the dream interpretation advises you to try to build your career because gambling will have a mountain of gold.\r  \n\r  \nThe meaning lies in the dream of seeing carp\r  \nTo dream of a fish is a good omen, fortune and prosperity will come to you in the near future. However, if you dream that a golden carp is eaten by a crocodile, it is a harbinger of trouble. It is best during this period to limit going out and be wary of strangers. When someone you're not familiar with taking leave will help you, and you can best solve the problem on your own by refusing to accept that help.\n\n\r\r  \nDreaming of dead fish  \nIt is a bad omen, a sign of the end of a relationship, things that should not be kept should be given up. Not only that, but this dream also helps you to put your past behind and move towards a better future. Meanwhile, if you see a bunch of processed fish and have a bad smell, this will indicate that you need to go through a difficult and hard time for yourself.  \nDreaming of a mermaid  \nThis is a good omen of love, you will meet your soul mate, the two are very compatible so a marriage will take place in the near future. In some cases, if the mermaid comes close to you and sings, it is a sign that your work is extremely favorable and business is thriving.  \nDreaming that I was eating fish  \nThis foretells you will be favorable, your career development opportunities are great. Continue to be confident in your ability, seize the opportunity well, you will surely succeed in the not too distant future. Not only that, this dream is also a symbol of your spirituality, health and life. Specifically, if you dreamed of carp eating meat, congratulations, good luck has come to you.  \n**&gt;&gt;&gt;See more:** [**https://mu88.watch/mo-thay-ca/**](https://mu88.watch/mo-thay-ca/)"

    "body": "*scene*\n\nI pull up to a parking lot at a park, having just spent the day, apparently my day off, playing basketball, skateboarding, and generally filling my day with things I enjoy. It's about 4:30 - 5:00 pm outside, and I proceeded to get out of my car and go for a walk in the park while sparking a joint.\n\nAs I get out, there is a mid 30's, brown haired, somewhat chubby, hippy dressed, red satchel wearing gentleman in a second, dirt parking lot in front of me, playing his guitar, singing, and dancing with some pretty decent talent. I spark my joint and watch, standing there, transfixed by his happiness. As I puff on my joint and head out for my walk, he approaches me.\n\n\"Awesome bro!\" I tell him, with a miniature applause. \"I really enjoyed your performance!\" I still have about a third of the joint left, so I hand it to him with the classic stoner 'Ere!, and ask him about himself.\n\nImmediately, it becomes apparent that he wasn't really all there. His singing did not transfer to being able to formulate real speech, and he definitely seemed nonverbal. I try to talk to him a while, telling him about my day, that I also play guitar and sing, and some other things, but eventually I give up and go on my walk. The walk is a fast forward in dream time, but I remember watching the sun start to descend.\n\nWhen I get back to the parking lot, I see him on the sidewalk of the dirt lot, rocking and fiddling and stimming in a mad, autistic sort of way. Realizing he is homeless, I want to help him. When I approach and ask him his name, and if I could get him some food or anything, he is just completely unaware of the world around him. I try for a bit to get his attention, but when I notice he still has the joint as I had handed it to him, unsmoked and intact, I give up and back away.\n\nAs I start my car, I notice his red satchel in the parking spot next to me, underneath the tire of another vehicle. I get out, pick it up and dust it off. Heading over to return it to him, I am already getting emotional at the sad sight of this man.\n\n\"Hey buddy,\" I say as I approach. \"You dropped your bag!\" I squat in front of him and try to hand it back, but he still doesn't notice me. Try as I might to break him of his trance, he just isn't in this world at the time. \"I'm just going to set it down here next to you, okay? Don't forget it again! I'm sure it's important.\"\n\nAt this point night has fallen, and the moon is bright. I start to turn away before standing up, and as soon as my eyes are off of him I am startled to feel his hand snatch my wrist. I turn back in shock, and he is looking at me with a piercing gaze, tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Thank you.\" He says.\n\nI immediately start to cry. Sobbing, I reach into my pocket saying, \"Can I please show you something?\" He nods, and as I pull out my phone to show him a picture of my real life 6 week old baby daughter, as I look at the phones screen...\n\n*scene*\n\nI wake up. With actual tears in my eyes, and still in the swings of a 1¬∞-1.5¬∞ fever.\n\nUpon waking, I definitely felt frustrated that I woke up before showing him the picture. It felt really important for some reason. I've been crying on and off since this dream, I honestly don't remember the last time I was this emotional for this long, if ever.\n\nI have an instinctual interpretation of this, but I want to hear what other people say without influencing your interpretation.\n\nThanks for reading."

It was vivid to where I remember this red/bloody moon that was getting bigger and a sense of fear, I also remembered that I could feel the world was about to end, the worst sense of doom. Then I can‚Äôt remember exactly but some kind of explosion or maybe the sun hit the earth. I just remember the feelings were so real and terrible but the only talking/interaction was the very end where I had this intense feeling that I just had to get the words ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù out of my mouth right before it was over/the world ends. I was needing to tell my kids, they are 3 and almost 5. I just cant shake the intense feeling at the end and it almost ended with relief, SO bizarre. \n\nI will add that my mom and sister and I are very open about our dreams since I was young. I have had dreams about family members passing before someone actually passes. I know it sounds crazy, but I am completely being  honest. My mom actually takes all of my vivid dreams serious. I am the youngest of 5, I have 3 brothers and a sister.\n\nThe last time I had a very emotional feeling dream was about my brother. I had dreamt that I was in this courtyard with pillars everywhere, kids waking around too. I was trying to get to my bother, I knew something was wrong but I didn‚Äôt know what. The emotion and feelings of dread and fear were so intense I woke up and started crying which I‚Äôve never done. I was just following him trying to get to him but he was just always right out of reach. Nothing bad happened in my dream but the bad feeling only intensified. I‚Äôll never forget this feeling, it felt like my soul was being ripped out of me.\n\nA week after this dream, my brother (same from my dream) almost died from a bowel perforation and the radiologist missed it TWICE. I‚Äôm a nurse, but I saw him in the hospital for the two days and the exact feelings from the dream I had in real life. I was actually physically feeling sick and so scared that this was actually happening. I had to tell the nurse that he was not ok and eventually was able to get a doctor in the room on the 3rd day. They called a rapid response immediately when the doc saw how terrible he looked; dusky. Within 2 hours he was in emergency surgery. I literally saved him, he was so close to the end it was unreal. They never figured out why or what caused this random perforation and he has no history. \n\nI have not been the same since this happened last March. I actually finally went for Cognitive processing therapy and realized I had ptsd from it all and thankfully doing much better.\nI just wanted to give a background on my dream history because I have had a hard time processing my dreams after it happening to my brother.\n\nFor once, nothing stressful or crazy is happening in my life.

Be sure to check if he has stopped breathing. Do you hear me?\" I immediately pushed her away and gave her a disgusted look as I backed away from her. I went over to where her son was laying and I picked him up. I looked at his mother again menacing as I make my way to the street to try and catch a cab. But luckily and police car was driving by and I waved at them to stop. Both cops came out from their car and I told them everything. After they've heard the whole story they went straight to the park and arrested my aunt and then I woke up."

The longer i stayed in care the more we loved eachother but i also remembered my marriage to my real life husband and it started to conflict me. I couldn't remember my husbands name or face. I just knew i was left in the hospitol with the doctor and not even a phone call from my husband to see if i'm ok. Last thing i remember before waking up was contacting him to tell him i'm moving on to be with the doctor. I'm genuinely shaken from this but still feeling so loved from the dream affair.

    "body": "This dream takes place at a Halloween style haunted house inside of a hospital.\n\nI remember standing in line for the haunted house, then two girls walk up to the guy in front of me in line and start talking to him. They turn to me and politely say ‚Äúwe‚Äôre so sorry to ask this, but is there any way we can cut in-front of you so we can stand in line with our friend?‚Äù I say ‚Äúof course!‚Äù And I scoot over. Everyone in line behind me gets so pissed and starts berating me and yelling at me. \nThe girl behind me starts calling me stupid and telling me everything‚Äôs my fault and blowing it really out of proportion. I stick up for myself (which I felt really proud of in my dream because I struggle with this irl) and tell her that was my decision, it wasn‚Äôt a big deal to let them cut and told her to fuck off basically. Then, her and her friend group pushed me, and cut in front of me. I pull her out of line to have a talk with her and ask why she‚Äôs being an asshole. As we‚Äôre talking, the line goes by and is already inside the haunted house‚Ä¶ she says ‚Äúgreat, now we‚Äôre both gonna miss the haunted house because of YOU‚Äù and then she storms off. Im the last person to enter the haunted house, so I start walking in that direction, but at some point, I make a wrong turn and end up in the hospital-y part of the hospital with sick patients in it. I suddenly hear a voice over the intercom say ‚ÄúATTENTION: The haunted House has been canceled, due to structural concerns in the building. If you are amongst those who have been injured, we are on our way to help.‚Äù I got disappointed and went to go exit the hospital, but somehow ended up inside the haunted house. It was dark and there were holes EVERYWHERE In the wooden floor where people had fallen through. I was trying to use my phone flashlight to go around them but there were so many and they were huge. I finally make it passed the holes into another part of the haunted house. There‚Äôs clown animatronics everywhere and I hear the voice over the intercom say REALLY LOUDLY ‚ÄúYou poor soul‚Ä¶you‚Äôre only 15 feet away from the entrance yet there‚Äôs no way out and you‚Äôre stuck in here forever‚Äù and then I abruptly woke up in a panic. \n\nAny thoughts?"

    "body": "**Some background:** He was a poor communicator unless we were in person and would constantly let me down, \"forget\" or go back on promises made. It was clear he didn't care or couldn't be bothered with me if i got too much for him i guess. I'd just be ignored until i waited long enough for him to reply or i essentially,  blew up his phone. which was usually what happened. I'd vent my frustrations, try to distance, ghost him even but he would act hurt by those actions and want me to \"come back\" to the friendship but never compromised on what i asked of him. Once he moved away, he didn't care about maintaining the friendship. It was rough but i eventually and finally removed him and stuck to it. With that out of the way let's get to the dreams...\n\nI've had about 3 vivid dreams about him. To preface, I don't remember my dreams. Ever. (Aka i dont dream) but whenever i wake up from a full rest and go back to sleep to catch some extra Zzz's, thats when i get the weirdest dreams like being young again with all my elementary class mates going through this maze like house while everyone is roasting/bullying me or trying to fight someone but my arms are like wet noodles no matter how hard i swing. I try to run away but im slower than a snail despite going full speed.\n\nWith him, the dreams were EXTREMELY WHOLESOME (he, irl is an antisocial loner who ill look you dead in the eye and walk away mid conversation if he doesn't know you and doesn't want to talk). The first one was last year so the memory has faded but the second one happened  a little over a month ago. I was in Laos and strangely i was there with the side of my family i dont like. It was a good time. Everyone was having fun on the beach, by the water etc. I went in to some sort of beach restaurant and i saw him from the corner of my eye but wasn't sure if he saw me, I avoided him and went back to my family. I see him walk by while im with them but this time we make eye contact. I don't acknowledge i just kind of act like i looked past him. I go back to the place where i first saw him (i think for food, idk its a dream lol) and he sees me again, eye contact again, but this time i smile but still look away. Next thing i know he's approaching me and he is in full uniform (Air force vet but was wearing a Marine uniform in my dream. Idk why) in front of me catching up with me and we end up just talking and walking along the beach and i eventually go my separate ways back to my family and then i wake up.\n\nThe reason i think im in Laos or even Vietnam at this time is because before i stopped talking to him, he was vacationing in one of these places which I also plan to go to for my own trip when im older. But I don't understand why i was having a good time with people I personally cutted out of my life.\n\nThe second dream i had today. Same situation of falling asleep again. I was with friends in this dream and we were having a good time (outside settingni believe. We were on a bench) then he appears and again, same old catching up but he's completely changed in physical appearance this time. He had outrageous ink and piercings and facial implants, grew his hair out longer than before had a whole different style too. It surprisingly didn't turn me away, i still found him easy on the eyes in the face. In this dream he was a lot more openly affectionate: hugs, sitting close, forehead kisses and just seeming like he changed but it was a maaaajor 180. All of these gestures I did not reciprocate or acknowledge. I just smiled and continue whatever i was doing.\n\nI guess what i want to know is, why am I having better-than-reality dreams about someone who I have long since cut off and want nothing to do with anymore? I genuinely dont miss him. He made me feel shitty about myself without even trying. And I went quite a long time (little over 3 months) without a thought or care or regard in the world about him. He is absolutely a chapter close. And yet my dreams make me feel like there's such a high possibility of us running in to each other again (there's not, i promise) if we do i will not act like everything is fine like i did last time. I will call him out and want answers if i ever have the displeasure of meeting him again. \n\nSo why the wholesome shit brain???"

For some reason we were in space, and started dancing together like we used to and floating weightlessly.

I don't remember the exact chronology of my dream but parts of it, which I will try to restitute :\n ‚Ä¢I remember being inside a sort of narrow towel entirely made up of stairs. I was surrounded by a thick crowd of persons, and most of them climbed up, but for some reason, I decided to follow two women who were climbing down. I extirpated myself of the ascending group and walked behind the two women. They were tidyly dressed, and I had a sudden spike of feeling powerful and special walking in the steps of these two non-conforming and supposedly clever and upper-classed ladies. I instantly visualized in my mind's eye myself wearing the same clothes as theirs and imitating their assertive attitude, which made me feel superior. But as we were progressing down, the stairs got completely tangled. But when I say tangled, I really mean it. Some parts of it even were more scale-looking, it was a mess. One woman disappeared, and the other tried not to fall. Her look turned less classy, and I could finally see her face. She had an exagerated expression of fear, and seemed way more ordinary than I had thought earlier. Concerning me, I was afraid of losing control and falling, everything around me was flimsy and cracked.\n ‚Ä¢Later in the dream, I was back home. I saw my cat and advanced towards her, but I felt something different about her. When I approached her, I coud remove her skin and fur. My real cat smelt her, shocked, and I didn't know how to react. I was numb.\n\nWhat could it mean ??"

Last night I had another nightmare about her banging on the front door of the house we grew up in and her yelling at my younger sister.

After a little bit of talking, we snuck off to the shipping bay of the building we were in.(the building was kinda like a supermarket) After talking about us and what we like and just getting to know each other better, I leaned in to kiss her and it she was laying on the floor I was over top of her with my eyes facing her chin. She said \"No, we are not kissing upside down, come over here and kiss me normally\". We did and when I opened my eyes, I was back in my chair from a couple hours earlier. After the convention finished, I realized that I had the ability to time travel and I don't know how I got it. I went to my best friend Jesse and I said the following (his mom was taking us home) \"Jesse, so I have the ability to time travel, don't ask how, I don't know. Anyways, I was talking to a girl and I kissed her. I had her, you know? I got a girlfriend! But then I accidentally timetravelled mid kiss and now I'm worried I won't ever get her back!\" \"What do I do?\" Jesse said \"idk man, if you really want this girl then no offense to my mom but screw her and go get her\" to this I said \"thanks bro, I love you\" and ran off to go get her.\n\nI made it in the building and then got arrested by the in building police because of disorderly conduct because apparently I was making a ruckus by running around the building looking for Maddison. As I was sitting in this tiny silverish black cell, I saw two guards outside at a long control panel facing away from the cell sitting down. Outside the cell, there was another inmate named Hunter Bryd sitting at the control panel with the guards. Our outfits were teal btw. Anyways, I had enough and time traveled to get out of this but little did I know I traveled back to a few minutes before I kissed Maddison and this time travel sent me to the timeline where I kissed and disappeared from her. I unknowingly went looking for her and couldn't find her. I decided to go back to my cell and serve my short time there (about 2 hours). I saw that they didn't even know I was gone because the two guards and hunter were watching a movie on a projector. I served my last 10 minutes and walked out. I tore off the prison stuff and it had my normal cloths underneath. As I walked down this white hallway, I saw a senior I knew, Ella. She knew Maddison. I ran to her and asked her if she has seen Maddison. She said to come with her because she was the head of security cameras. As I walked into her room, Maddison came down the hallway crying. At that moment, I realized that I was back in my original timeline. I ran to Maddison and asked her what's wrong. She kept crying. I asked her if she wanted to go to a place more private to talk and she said yes. We walked to Ella's room because I knew Ella didn't mind. When we got in there, we laid on the bed and I tried to talk to her. She pushed me over on my back and tried to straddle me. She asked what I wanted and I said \"I want you to be my girlfriend.\" She seemed upset and confused by this. I assume it was because I didn't explain my sudden disappearance. She ran out crying and I chased after her. \n\nThat is all I remember from this dream."

    "body": "About a month ago, I had a very strange and memorable dream about someone I‚Äôve only ever seen a few times in an old photograph, about 110 years old. The person in question, for whatever reason, did have a vague sort of familiarity to them, but I have not been able to place my finger on a relation to any person I‚Äôve met in my waking life. A few weeks after seeing the photo, I had pretty much not thought about it much at all, until I went to sleep on a Friday night, and had this dream. In the dream, I appeared on a dirt path running from left to right, with an old house directly in front of me. Everything in the dream was in black and white. The girl from the photo was standing in the doorway, and behind her, inside the house, was pure pitch blackness. When we saw each other, there was a moment of extreme elation between both of us, and we met each other on the porch of this house and hugged, both very happy to see each other. Like two old friends meeting after many years. The dream then skipped to what I thought was the inside of this house, sitting on an old style couch. We were sitting side by side, looking rigidly straight ahead. We never turned to look at each other, but I could see her also looking straight ahead in my peripheral vision. Ahead of me, I could see only a sparse wooden plank floor stretching on for about 15 feet, and then it faded to just darkness. I could not see the end of the room. For whatever reason, I became aware that we were unable to speak to each other, but we could sort of feel each others emotions, and we were surrounded by the most warm happy feeling, like just so happy to even exist next to each other. And then, she simply leaned over, and pushed her left cheek against my right cheek, and it was extremely surprising to me in the dream. I could feel every detail of her face. It was the most real and detailed physical sensation I‚Äôve ever had in a dream. She then simply pulled away without a word, and we continued to stare straight on into this darkness. The dream then skipped to us in a standing position, her directly in front of me with her back to me, and me with my hands on both of her shoulders from behind, still just looking straight ahead. I made note of how small and fragile her frame felt, too small for her, and it concerned me for a moment. She was shorter than me, coming up to about the bottom of my chin, and I could just make out the top and back of her head as we both looked forward. It then felt like she took me to a doorway, still in the same position as before, except now we were looking into a small ornate mirror on the wall inside this room. And we just stood there, staring at ourselves in this mirror, still surrounded by that same incredible warm feeling from before. She wore the slightest smirk on her face as we looked into the mirror, and I noted to myself that she was really pretty. And then it was over."

    "body": "hi! i‚Äôm very curious what this dream symbolizes to y‚Äôall. \n\nlast night i had a dream involving one headless snake and two snakes with heads. the headless snake was wrapped in a sheet, but it was still very much alive. i don‚Äôt remember the full context of the dream, but i remember running past the headless snake. it was slithering very quickly along with me - not really chasing me, just going in the same direction as me. the front half of it was standing up straight and writhing all around while it was slithering. you couldn‚Äôt actually see that it was headless because the sheet was covering it, but i was just very aware that it had no head. there was a man running behind me. i knew him in my dream, but he isn‚Äôt actually someone i know in real life. he told me that the people we were running to meet had chopped off the snake‚Äôs head. i remember saying they shouldn‚Äôt have done that because the snake wasn‚Äôt even venomous. then at some point, we stumbled upon 2 more snakes that i think were rattlesnakes. we were all going in the same direction. \n\nnone of the snakes were trying to hurt us, and i don‚Äôt remember feeling scared of any of them. i just remember wanting to help fix the headless one. i have no idea where we running or who we were meeting or why. i really just remember this part about the snakes."

    "body": "Years ago, I had a dream that I walked into my bedroom and my daughter, who was about 9 or 10 years old at the time, was laying (asleep) horizontally on my bed with her legs hanging off the side. This wasn't abnormal as she always slept with us since she was a baby. \nI stopped in the doorway because floating above her was a giant eye. It was like it was scanning her or studying her. It wasn't harming her and I didn't feel scared at all. It floated above her looking at her, then looked over at me briefly, I was still standing in the doorway, and then went back to looking at her. Then I noticed my daughter's eyes were rolled back in her head, but again, I didn't feel anxiety like in a nightmare. It was very vivid and I woke up questioning if it had actually happened. \nSomeone interpreted this dream for me when I had it 10+ years ago, but I cant find the interpretation and wondered if I would get the same interpretation a second time too. \nDoes anyone know the meaning behind this dream? for my daughter and/or me?"

Lastly the void space when I drift in a chasm of nothingness. \n\nThis dream took place in the bizzaro world and it involved me at first just flirting with an old friend to me getting mad at my fianc√©e and leaving her to chase my old friend.

I thought about reaching out to this friend just to say hi but we didn‚Äôt go out separate ways on good terms so I chose not to.

    "body": "I was in my high-school age hometown, on my way to school (I think at this stage I was driving). As I was crossing a major junction, there was a pop-up flower shop with a 50% sale. I stop to grab a single orange delphinium and continue on my way to school (now walking). \n\nMajor train tracks run through my hometown. As I was walking, ahead there was a stationary train about to depart. It was cargo toward the rear, two vagrants were train hopping. The train starts to leave, one gets on, the second throws his bag up but quickly the space to jump is too great and he misses it. \n\nSuddenly, I‚Äôm now on the train. In a passenger carriage. The dirty vagrants are next to me, the one who missed saunters in and sits down with his friends. We are moving quickly. We aren‚Äôt going to school, it doesn‚Äôt stop there like I thought it did. That‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll get off at the next stop. The next stop is somewhere unfamiliar to me. It‚Äôs high in mountains. We‚Äôve travelled through tunnels to get there. We pull into the station. It‚Äôs a dead-end, the last stop. I leave the train-station quickly because I feel anxious, I want to walk back to my hometown. \n\nI have to walk down the mountain. It‚Äôs a rocky ravine, it‚Äôs dangerous - like a goat-track and I‚Äôm scared. I have a sandwich with me and I don‚Äôt want to drop it over the side. There‚Äôs all sorts of hazards including slippery plastic on the track. Two 30-40yo women are coming up. They have sneakers on. I don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre better prepared than I am. They tell me that I‚Äôm going the wrong way. If I carry on, it‚Äôs a 3 hour journey to the next town (which is in the wrong direction I want to travel in). \n\nI look around to try and see landmarks. I‚Äôm confused because the landmarks keep changing. Now the ladies have told me where I am, I can orient myself. I‚Äôll have to go back up to the train-station to return to town after all, it‚Äôs the safest option. \n\nSo I‚Äôm climbing back up. All of a sudden there‚Äôs all these grandmas climbing toward the train station. I ask if they can hold my sandwich in their handbag so that I can climb up too. I‚Äôve removed the plastic from the ledge so that everyone can walk smoothly and won‚Äôt slip. The old lady directly behind me grudgingly puts my sandwich in her bag, but she wants to get past me. We take a couple steps before she hands my sandwich back and tells me that I better look after it if I want to get back. \n\nShe pulls out a map (it looks like the marauders map from Harry Potter, it‚Äôs a magic map) and it starts self-drawing to reveal the route the train took through the tunnels and mountains. It‚Äôs not at all the route I thought I was going. Now I‚Äôm going up to the train to catch it back to my hometown to start over. \n\nNote: I lived in two towns, one aged 0-14 and a second 14-18. This setting is the latter. I now (31) live overseas &amp; have for a decade. I was my current-age in this dream."

I honestly dont actually want to work because I feel like it's too early to commit but too late to be wasting time, maybe that's got something to do with this reoccuring dreams. I got my first job at sales on may 15 and that's the first time I dreamt of dying. \n\nMy dream goes like this, I was at my workplace just doing MS stuff then suddenly our store was getting robbed and i got hold at gunpoint. at that point my heart was pumping. i dont know why but i tried stealing the gun away but got shot in the head. my body heats up then i woke up. i dont remember every dreams but im most certain that every day i die in my dream, and each dream i die and wake up with my heart pumping and my body heating up. \n\nThen fast forward to may 27, i got a call from my boss that i am fired, im gonna be honest... i got fired because i have no motivation at work, or working in general so im both happy and relieved that i got fired. because i couldnt quit my job because of the paperwork that has been processed, if i quit then i will have problems with the government of labour or whatever, but if i get fired then i wouldnt have any problems at all. after all that i slept like a log and then it happens again, but this time ive got my dad with me. my dad was shot when i was driving him to his work, i panicked and just drove quickly to a nearest hospital. while carrying my dad to the hospital i looked back and got held at gunpoint, got shot at my legs then shot my ear. at that point i knew i was gonna die so i accepted it and then the final bullet came through my head. ghen everything goes black, i see a timer from 5&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1, then the timer goes zero. i knew i died, but what i felt was different, before my heart races and my body heats up but this time i felt like i am truly dead... then peaceful of darkness for a few seconds then my eyes slowly opens. then i realized i was dreaming and did not actually die, then i fall asleep again... i wasnt sure why but i knew i was dead but i wasnt. it mentally changed me... i dont know anymore"

It was a little dingy in there, and it was very, very shot back; it was a massive room, full of all the same furniture (it all went together very well) and the family was mostly men. And I think the reason why we were there is because I started dating an Italian man with possibility of being the head, or soon to be, of his family‚Äôs mafia.\nMy sister, as old as we are, still likes to try and embarrass me IRL. She told me something along the lines of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt sit down and eat, you‚Äôve already eaten and you at least need to dress nicer‚Äú but a little meaner and snarky. Mind you, I was the one that got us in with this family because of someone‚Äôs interest in me, someone who wants to potentially marry me thus introducing our families together, someone thinks highly of me enough to do this, they think I‚Äôm beautiful and worthy no matter what. \nSo, biting my tongue, I walked away and said nothing, even though I wanted more than anything to verbally lash out at her due to how deeply she hurt my feelings. I went to go find our mother to go sit with and just sit with because she has a tendency of taking my sister side‚Ä¶ So I knew I couldn‚Äôt vent to her about the situation, I just wanted to be around someone I knew and try to calm down. \n\nThe dream transitions.\n\nNow we‚Äôre outside the compound, and my sister wanted to take a carriage, and I suppose I was the only one that was allowed to drive it. She said ‚ÄúI want to go to the Galleria.‚Äù my response to that was, ‚ÄúHow on earth, do you expect us to go to the galleria in a horse-drawn carriage? It‚Äôll take forever!‚Äù Still I thought maybe I can appease her by taking a little short drive. So she told me to just use the white one. It‚Äôs a single person one and it‚Äôs just four of us (two being her small children), so I abide her request and go and try to retrieve the carriage; It was in a little barn above a pond, and once I went to go get it, it was just a re-purposed washer with wheels. üôÑ"

I think I also tried to have someone else make it for me but they didn't make it right so I made it myseld. I chose batman and some blonde character I can't remember the name of. Put the blonde character in the flower as if she were trapped and reenacted a senario where batman was saving her. All of the projects were stupid but no one clapped for mine rip. \n\n- Was in a gemini home entertainment type world (apocalyptic fiction on yt) where I had to drive a car at night. Drove with my sister to make her scared because for some reason I though it was a virtual game at first. Animals with bright lights for eyes at the side of the road very creepy. Had to stop to get fuel but another car was coming, tried to do it quickly with my sister (got mad at her) and managed to but only just as the car got there. I think I tried going around the car at first but then got out of mine and I ran off and started lying down in some snow.

It seemed like someone was messing with the sky, similar to one of those view-masters.\n\nIt was changing so fast that I had to close my eyes in the dream so that I wouldn‚Äôt have a seizure (I‚Äôve never had one it was just going from dark to light so fast, it was intense). I don‚Äôt recall recall clouds or even stars, mostly the sun and moon change of placement.\n\nWhen it stopped, it seemed to be sunset time, the sun in an unfamiliar location casting unfamiliar shadows, and illuminating areas on a mountain range that I had never seen before. It was un familiar and uncomfortable, and that seems to be a significant feeling in this dream. \n\nOnly my mother and I noticed it. No one else in the area did. But they knew something was up because they started preparing for either leaving or dying.\n\nIn my dreams, I know fully well how significant and vast the sky is.

(21 now) For a long time I felt very mistreated by her because she would say or do hurtful things and not take my feelings seriously. She has severe mental health issues so I couldn't really stay mad at her since I was scared for her health, and little worried about being alone cause I had a hard time connecting with other people.\n\nWe lived together 2 years ago for 6 months. She was a horrible roommate and bit before she moved away she cut her wrists right Infront of me during an argument. I have currently taken distance from her but still share mutual friends.\n\nThe dream itself:\nI lived in my parents house with my family. For some reason this childhood friend also lived with us. It started with a really childish argument about what fictional character we were allowed to like. She wanted to have one of mine I have had for a long time and didn't want to give her. She ended up getting so mad she cried about how unfair it was while wrestling with me. Then she left mad and even though she didn't really say anything I knew if I did anything that made her more mad something really bad would happen to me.\n\nI saw her again in the kitchen while making food for everyone and seeing me made her so mad that she straight up said she would stab me and kill me if I did anything else. I went to my mum's room and cried to her how horrible my friend is. The whole time I was a bit scared she would hear and hurt me or someone else in my family. Mum comforted me by saying how horrible my friend is and what she did was illegal. The dream ended in a feeling of helplessness though.\n\nThis dream is very unusual to me and I don't understand what it means for our relationship. I also have bit of a hard time understanding my feelings about stuff."

I had a dream maybe a month ago, I was at my dad's house and there was a ghost in the bathroom. I had holy water and just kept it with me. Eventually I got along with it and became friends. It turns out it was not a ghost but a demon. After a while he decided to show himself, i went outside and he revealed himself to me. He was Lucifer. I was gapping at how beutiful he was. Not like I was attracted but I was in awe. I was so emotional and in awe that I fell to my knees and started crying while holding him. I felt that feeling deep down in my soul. I woke up and I still felt the feeling. It's one of the strongest dreams I've had. A deep part of me wants it to mean somthing.

    "body": "\r  \n**What is the dream meaning of not wearing clothes?**\n\nDreaming of being naked has several meanings. All are reflections of the present mind of the dreamer. It could be a problem that has been reported and needs to be fixed, or it could just be a re-enactment of what the dreamer had in mind.\r  \n\r  \nMany people believe that dream interpretation is extremely necessary because it can give you omens about the past, present or future in study, work, health, love, etc.\r  \n\r  \nTo dream that you are naked indicates that you are deliberately running away. This dream also represents being shunned, hated, afraid of being ridiculed by others.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are in a new love and dream of being naked, this dream suggests that you are nervous or afraid to express your thoughts and feelings to that person.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, this is just one of the ways to interpret the dream of seeing yourself without clothes. Because in each dream, the circumstances, details and images appear different. Therefore, in order to know the most specific and accurate omens, we must interpret separately in each specific case.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream interpretation of not wearing clothes good or bad?**\r  \nAccording to experts, dreams involving naked people often reflect things related to all your relationships. Specifically, the dream owner will meet the market in the near future. Therefore, you need to pay more attention to every word, including yourself.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming of walking but not wearing clothes**\r  \nIn your dream, you see yourself walking through a crowd of people naked. What does this undressed dream imply? This dream shows that you are a person who is easily hurt or embarrassed in front of others.\n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;See more:** [**https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/**](https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/)\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being naked in the classroom, at work**\r  \nIf you dreamed that you were naked at work, in class, such a dream indicates that you are not really ready for a certain plan. You feel stressed and confused when making decisions, especially when the attention of many people makes this problem even more serious.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream of not wearing clothes but no one notices**\r  \nIf in your dream appears the image of you naked but no one notices or notices that. This dream shows that your fears are completely unfounded. You yearn for more people to notice you.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being proud of my nudes**\r  \nIf one day you dream that you are naked but completely proud and unashamed, it is a sign that you are a free spirit. You always feel proud of yourself and your mood is always comfortable and happy.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming that I was stripped of my clothes, without a piece of cloth to cover my body**\r  \nTo dream that you are stripped of your clothes, without a piece of cloth, indicates that you have recently been entangled in some bad things, many rumors are not good for you. They make you feel humiliated and ashamed. You feel scared and worried if you let other people know. What you need to do is stay calm so you can handle things."

The manner of death has caused me to feel a kind of way and re-evaluate all the interactions I remember having with him which tend to skew negative.

Anyway I know that's not my fault but that is easier to say than it is to believe. \n\nI continue to have complicated feelings about it to this day, but basically today is his birthday and in a month will be the 13 year anniversary of his death. This may have stirred things up because I was keeping myself aware of it so that I could text my mom and offer comfort if she needed it. However, I've never had a dream directly about him before now. If anything, it was mentioned in passing or was implied, but I never had physically seen him in my dreams that I can remember. And since its been over a decade we don't really feel impacted by the anniversary unless its like a big one. \n\nNow onto the dream. In the dream I was myself as a child, probably around the age that he died and we were in a house I was unfamiliar with. So in my early childhood, my parents were off and on and in this dream my dad came home with a new girlfriend. She seemed nice enough and really supported him to the point of slightly disliking myself, my sister, and my mom. But this led to us not liking her all that much, so it was suggested that I scare her. I put on some three part black outfit, I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be and hid behind a door. When she opened it, I kinda hissed but I didn't get a reaction. Then I think one of them said they were going to take our cat (or I felt like it was implied that they were going to hurt it - which is not something he would do as a person but mirrors a situation where I thought he had cremated our cat when I was very young) so I was naturally very mad and upset. I grabbed the cat and ran into a bedroom, I did not see my dad for the remainder of the dream nor did he say anything else, but I remember that I suddenly felt the anger, sadness, and disappointment he felt about me and my actions. I started crying unconsolably for several minutes because it felt like he would never forgive me. \n\nThen it was like a hard cut to a school theatre play I was doing tech for (so random but I did do this in middle school). I thought he would come out to at least support me, but when I walked outside to find my parents after it was done, I only saw my mom. I began crying super hard again which is when my mom introduced me to some guy that I don't recognize from my real life. But again I had the feeling that he knew my dad and he was trying to console me by telling me about a similar situation he had been in or something. That's when I got a phone call and woke up, but I just feel super gross and really bad about the dream and would like to understand it. Is it just a manifestation of that scenario that actually happened or something deeper? Also like why now?"

But we ended up in an argument where many verbal blows were exchanged. It became so bad to the point that everything she tried to insult me, I recounted her crimes against children and other people. She eventually fell to her knees crying \"why don't you care about me?\" And this angered me so much I whipped around and held her face as delicately as I could in my hands and looked her in her eyes saying \"Why should I care about your life, when you never cared for mine?\" \nAnd smiled urging her to die with what little dignity she had left.

I could see myself in the back of my parents car wondering why the fuck they did not call the ambulance.

I had bought a very old run down house with old furnishings etc still there, it looked to have been well lived in but completely abandoned with everything still there. It was like a maze too, so many rooms and floors. I was exploring the house and trying to do a bit of tidying up, when in one of the bathrooms I found a bath that was part of the structure, like an old Roman type bath maybe. I turned the water on to try and test it to make sure it actually worked, when water started flowing into the bath a massive bunch of spiders (huge spiders üò≥üò≥) came running out the wall attached to the bath. I freaked out and turned the water off, they ran back into the wall. Left the room and explored more, went into another room and found a large bunch of cats that were mostly feral but they were actually very healthy looking. Some of them were friendly, others were hissing at me, others were distant but curious. First thought was to call SSPCA as a bunch of abandoned cats, wanted them to be rescued and checked over by a vet. Went exploring a bit more and in another room I found a bunch of dogs, all pretty friendly thankfully and looking healthy. Then in another room I found a mixed bunch of cats and dogs with some rabbits in the mix, all very friendly and coexisting together peacefully and looking healthy. In this room there was also a good amount of those massive spiders on the wall. Very bizarre and has left me a bit confused"

When I woke up, I did not know if it actually occurred or was just a dream. At one point during the dream I became self aware that I was dreaming and I wanted it to keep going as long as possible. However I had no control over what was happening in the dream, everything kept going and I just went along with it. So in this dream, I was myself as I am (20f) and I was the girlfriend of a famous singer (20m). I wont say who he is because none of you will know who he is and also its not really relevant. Now something about this singer, he‚Äôs the complete opposite of me and when they say opposites attract I used to never believe in that kind of stuff but for some time now I have been attracted to him like if he was a literal magnet. I am completely mesmerized. Because I am fascinated by his personality and lately I have learned a lot about myself even if it‚Äôs just from having on a crush on this guy. In the dream, it was the night of his concert, and I felt amazing. Let me tell you something about myself: I am very shy, serious, not the type to even enjoy a concert, but here in my dream I was having the time of my life! I felt safe and secure despite being in a large crowd. I felt an overwhelming amount of confidence which I have never experienced in real life. Then the singer (my boyfriend in my dream) took me backstage. And basically I just felt completely in love with him and he was obsessed and in love with me as well?!Again, this guy is very different from anyone I have ever felt interest in real life. And it‚Äôs not just because he‚Äôs famous or whatever, it‚Äôs because of his personality: his carefree laidback attitude, his ability to make friends easily, and the way he‚Äôs relaxed and easygoing about life is polar opposite from me. The dream ended when I began to realize I was dreaming. It ended off by him bringing me onto stage with him and introducing me to the crowd as his girlfriend. The crowd went wild and began screaming in excitement. And that‚Äôs the end. So can someone help me understand what this means?! I‚Äôm a girl who just stays at home reading books and never goes out at all, and suddenly I have the most intense realistic dream of my entire life where I am a rockstar‚Äôs girlfriend? Help Lol"

A woman enters through a doorway, wearing a teal dress of intricate design and patterns, shiny with inlaid gems of blue, and takes a seat next to me. She holds out her hand and tells me to take it. I oblige and after a few seconds she asks if I could feel anything yet, and as I say no I felt our connection vibrate and glow blue and suddenly I am somewhere pitch black and confused. I feel a terrible presence enter and I crumble to the ground, trembling, and too afraid to look. I felt dirtier than ever before, and he chides me and tells me how minuscule and pathetic I looked. He said LOOK AT YOU, ARE YOU A COWARD? Pushing past the fear I muster \"I'm not a coward, I'm A FUCKING WARRIOR!\" And he says THEN GET UP AND START ACTING LIKE ONE! And I leapt up to my feet and bellowed a terrible roar as if to challenge heaven itself, my body ripped and muscles and veins bulging and a readiness to tear evil limb from limb. I realize no one is there, and I fade from that state of consciousness. I awaken on my back yet off the ground somewhere outside, a medium sized tree in the background, but I was surrounded by several figures. I didn't move. Only one of the figures looked human, like the ideal form of man but seemingly made of concrete. He wore a skull cap and trousers and a slight smirk. The rest I can hardly describe, but two of them in front of me looked vaguely humanoid, one had one eye and one had too many. They all held jars in their hands at center height. I start to fade out again as the figures close in around me with their jars and sticking my limbs in them and then I wake up on the barstool again next to the woman. She tells me I did well and I ask her who the statue man was, she said that was Adam. Then I woke up.\n\nHappened about a week before a beloved pet of mine died that helped pull me out of a downspiral, war experience had taken a toll on my humanity but he reminded me of just how human I still was. I took it better than I feared and expected. I only told my wife and a couple of friends, one was understanding and helpful  and one I think was weirded out and I lost contact with.

    "body": "First post here, i am a 24 years old male, kinda introvert, there was something bugging me from years,since i have 7 years if i remember correctly, almost all my dreams take place in a Floating continent in Darkness, 3 times the size of earth,since i was little a LOT of my dreams takes place here, and is easy to know, because everytime i see the sky in my dream world is always black devoid of stars,there are only 2 smalls suns, a huge moon with a missing part in it,and a weird Red Star or glow in the darkness that only appear around  middle night, and if you get outside while the red star is glowing a lot of horrible creatures that looks like shadows from afar will appear all around the place,and it last for a hour if someone is outside,if all the people are inside buildings, the star will glow for 1 minute and disappear,so is safe to hide when that happens,describing my dream world perfectly is hard, because there is still a lot of places that i dont have reached yet, a simple description is a huge mass of land with a really tall spike mountains in the center, there are forest,plains,caves,swamps,deserts and really cold places, in the center,where the mountain is,there is a huge city in there,in one of my dreams i remember entering the capitol and there being a huge map of the world in there,a lot of places are unknown, there are varius cities and villages, and ruins too in the south east there is a village where you can reach a ocean,but the ocean from my dream world is weird,cause is alive,not like alive with fish and plants, the ocean itself is a sentient being, it will move around the continent from time to time,so the people living there settled around places were it tends to stop for at least 2 days, is full of life too, there are fish plants and the like but there is not ocean floor,only the void from below the continent. it can get agressive too if people hunt to much fish from it or when the red star is shining, so it will tend to destroy villages close to the cliff borders of the continent. the days are kinda normal,the sky is black but there is light from the suns,clouds and rains.but like in the earth where the atmosfere is blue that dont happen there,about the era of civilization is weird, some cities are modern,some are from the past, and there are no airplanes, or methods to travel in the sky, only cars,horses or being in the ocean when is moving around the continent. in one of the cities around north there is a huge bridge,is really long and big,people can cross it without problem, i have seen another continent in the other side,but i cant cross it,i have died already 3 times trying crossing it,the first i was shot by a robber,i could feel my blood flowing from my wound and the loss of my senses, when i died that time i was only 11 years old, so i got really scare,another time i was crossing in a car and around halfway the bridge huge shadow arms came from below the bridge and pushed me and others cars to the void, other time i tried again and before reaching on foot halfway the bridge the red star appeared and i got killed by the monsters, it was not painful lucky me,but up close they are hideous,they where decaying and not humanoid like,they where a deformity if you could say. after dying 3 times crossing i havent tried anymore,or at least,any more dreams close to that bridge havent appear anymore. i have die more times but in other places, one place is a part where there is a crater and inside that crater is a forest,in the middle is a lake with a perpetual tornado in it, i think i was around 8 years old when in a dream i died there,i could feel the tornado picking me up and throwing me really far away and before i crashed to the ground i woke up sweating.i remember a small urban zone in the top of the crater with grave holes empty and various persons around,they didnt say anything about the empty graves. in the city there are always a lot of persons,persons that i dont know or have seen in my life,they can talk,interact and have feelings,but when i ask about the other continent or about the weird red star they get dead silent and the surrounding too,they stop blinking and it gets creepy and unconfortable,so i tend to leave or change the topic quickly. is a extensive place, i dare say that i have explored only 10 or 20% of that place,and mostly cities,villages,forest or ruins.some ruins give me a bad vibe and a feeling that i should leave,one of the most impactful ruins i visited was a long passage around 2 cliff that was dark,in the wall there where various statues of persons really huge,they all where without head,only bodies,and they where tall like a 5 floor high building, in the end of the passage there was a big stone wall with bones and a broken door, inside that area there was thousands of giants bone arms reaching the sky from the ground, there was a heavy fog around and i got a feeling that i was being observed,in the middle there was something behind the fog that was looking me, i got chills and gose pumps around my body and something was telling me inside to run, so i did and in the passage i hear a creepy and chilly scream coming from there that woke me up scared and crying, it was around  when i was 10 or so  it gived me a scare.there is even more but it would be really long, what i want to know is,why i cant cross that bridge,and why the place is that weird?. oh and about the dreams that dont hapen in that place,they happen in earth and tends to be really cosmic like."

It must‚Äôve been days later when I woke up. I could tell that I was deep deep in the ocean. I‚Äôve always been kind of a loner, so, when I got out of my cabin and looked everywhere, no one was there. The first few floors were completely flooded. I had no way to get out even if I wanted to. If I could get out where would I go? Even if I had special equipment, I doubt I would be able to make it. The pressure of the water would probably kill me first. Then it would likely be the nitrate bubbles from swimming upwards too fast. Even if I somehow made it up to the surface alright, I‚Äôd be lost in the middle of the sea. So I had no choice but just wait. I ate the food that was still okay to eat. \n\nI think I passed down in the dream. Because in the later parts, I had a swim outside the ship and get some food that was just outside. I work at a Bakery in real life and that‚Äôs the food that was there. Cakes and croissants that are just looking nasty from being underwater but I had to get them. One of the head chef‚Äôs for my job was there helping me."

    "body": "So to start off, I‚Äôm a 30-something male married to a 30-something female. I hardly ever remember my dreams. Like, ever. That‚Äôs why this is strange to me that I remember this one. In fact, during the dream, it felt so much like reality that when I woke up, I thought that I was dreaming.\n\nI‚Äôm not particularly proud of the dream, although I‚Äôm very curious of its meaning.\n\nThe dream: \nI don‚Äôt remember much about the setting now, the colors, etc. but I recall there being two sofas in a room. The room was relatively small, I‚Äôm thinking maybe 12-14 foot wide by 20 foot long, can‚Äôt remember the height though I feel like the ceilings were low. The space felt sort of cozy. On one of the sofas was my wife, alone‚Ä¶ she may have been sleeping there, can‚Äôt recall. On the other sofa was me and another female. I don‚Äôt recall a face (other than thinking she was gorgeous) or a name. The only thing I really remember is that she had tattoos that were very deep in meaning to her. One I was so intrigued about was on her upper chest. I can‚Äôt remember the subject matter in the tattoo now but I do remember that it was rectangle in shape and the subject matter existed inside of the rectangle. I almost feel like it was a cup or a kettle on a stove. I do remember the other tattoo, it was on her right hand and wrist, like ocean coral and shells. It was vibrant and detailed. I can recall a feeling in the dream. Like this other female was an acquaintance but we both felt something for each other while feeling like I was trying to be discreet about that with my wife directly across from us. I don‚Äôt recall doing anything necessarily inappropriate other than sitting extremely close. \n\nFurther context: I will admit, I‚Äôve felt lonely for a while now. My wife doesn‚Äôt come to bed with me and when she does, she never sleeps close to me or really acknowledges that I exist there. Sometimes I wake up when she‚Äôs getting into bed but I‚Äôll lay there with my eyes closed to see if she acknowledges me at all‚Ä¶ and no, she just lays there, turned the other way on her cellphone. She‚Äôs usually good otherwise, taking care of the kids, the house‚Ä¶ we have fun together, but it feels more like a roommate dynamic (even with our children) now rather than a marriage.\n\nCan anyone help to decipher this dream in some way? I probably wouldn‚Äôt really care if I remembered more of my dreams. I just find it quite odd that this is one I do remember. Thank you."

I ran into my parents there for some odd reason. This old but fashionable woman that I didn‚Äôt know approached me and complimented a fur coat I was wearing. I said thank you. Later I went back to my room to discover that the door was open. The old woman came out carrying another coat of mine, and offered to trade this fur vest in exchange for the other coat. I told her that I didn‚Äôt want the vest but she could just have the coat anyway since I didn‚Äôt really like it anyway.

Later I was just hanging in my hotel room and checked my bank balance and it was less than I‚Äôd thought but the statements were consistent with where I‚Äôd been so I figured I‚Äôd just spent more than I thought. My card was still in my wallet. I checked again later and my balance just kept dropping and dropping. I tried to freeze my account but my bank app kept loading.

Sure enough, it starts to make me float and I begin to protect myself by repeatedly saying ‚ÄúI am divinely protected‚Äù, but this entity is trying to silence me by muffling my words, and I have fight to speak and get the words out. I can feel that I am physically restrained when trying to speak too. I have to fight, and sincerely resist this force and cannot be overtaken by it.\n\nThis time, however I‚Äôm adding in the lines ‚ÄúI banish you back to hell from whence you came‚Äù ‚Äúbe gone‚Äù, and I recall the entity gets forced down a hall and into room, where the door shuts. I am still floating by force, and it seems another entity has showed up.\n\nI turned my attention to it and I keep doing the same thing‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve forgotten how it ends but I woke up.\n\n\nThe first time I had this dream of being forced into the air and was floating, it took place in some attic with high, vaulted ceilings, and the entity looked to be cloaked in black and was also floating. I had only been in that attic dreamscape once before, first time no entity present, and sometimes I go back to it and realize it‚Äôs not a good place to be &amp; will wake myself up.\n\nThe forced floating sensation, and being unable to speak feels real, I feel I am physically resisting something.\n\nBut yeah, I keep having these dreams and this last one was far more intense and too close of an interaction for my comfort. \n\nI am not a member of an organized religion, and this entity seems like it may be part of one."

But they show that reality is halved and repressed.   \n\nSome of the only ways I can describe them, a sense filled me, I knew what was happening, it was so devastating and beautiful; I was being destroyed and reminded - all that was familiar, all reference points, all identity -- all viciously shattered and reformed in moments. I can‚Äôt even recognize the feelings, they‚Äôre unrecognizable - just a momentary glimpse of the other side, of the other feelings.  \n\nSo extreme and vivid, in one dream, on a roof on a building, again, reality is morphed, but still recognizable. I was with someone, it wasn‚Äôt love. The feeling, of everything. How our sociality confounded itself in this dream, how it linked together, the epitome - essence of it, you could feel it. So beautiful. They and I‚Ä¶ we knew each other. The aftertaste is so beautiful and vivid. So entrancing and consuming, it absorbs me with each phase of thought and every note. So inexplicable. I find myself enslaved but it, like a cleansing rain it washes over the me, this indescribable feeling. the most INTENSE feeling on this planet. I can taste the aftertaste, the glimpses are so beautiful, before it becomes lost to a black void I can only barely remember.  \n\nThe feelings, of equilibrium like in some of my dreams, in some dreams, it‚Äôs the strongest ever, Very vivid. The environment and it‚Äôs entirety plotted out in semblances of quintessence. The aftertaste lying in bed is one of the best feelings ever. When I woke up, I felt a longing, a desire for something that isn't possible. It‚Äôs so ecstatic. I felt a strange euphoria and happiness. I could taste the afterthought of the emotion, but couldn't connect it to an existing physical meaning like with normal emotions.  \n\nEvery second of my life I spend longing for the dreams, I oversleep so often, just hoping that the feelings return.

We got a call from one of our friends (who it was is unknown, but the feeling was \"friend\") who let us know they had a dream that the world was about to end. \n\nWe looked online to see if there was anything going on, and basically there was a sudden countdown timer for, like, 5 minutes until doomsday. There wasn't any specific event that was predicted, just The End and everyone would die. \n\nI went through all the stages of grief in my dream in a very short time and before we knew it, my husband I were just holding each other waiting for The End (or not). I didnt think it would happen until my consciousness saw a massive red dust wave just whoosh across the planet (i was omniscient for a moment) in about 4 seconds, then i saw it over his shoulder coming for us, and then it was all black. \n\nThe next thing that happened is I was a thought, all encompassing, in the cosmos. I had no body, no form, just consciousness. I spoke to my husband there and also everyone else on earth who had died- we were all one with private conversations happening simultaneously. We thought, \"hey, this isn't so bad!\" Until a giant blackhole opened in the heart of the very universe itself and the universe started imploding. \n\nWe all watched as planets, stars, images of war, memes, ideas, everything material and not material that we know (but was MADE into an image being sucked in, it had a physical symbol, if that makes sense) was destroyed until the edges of the universe closed in on us like a pool of water going down a drain. \n\nNothingness. But obviously, I didn't know because I wasn't there. Next thing that happened, I woke up next to my husband and a similar day replayed- but I had given him a trinket during the 5 minute doomsday countdown, and he still had it with him so we remembered everything that had just happened and it was over. \n\nMy initial thoughts are stress, but I FELT so high, so free, so powerful being in the cosmos.

In the dream, it kept trying to bite me. Eventually, the rattlesnake's head was separated from its body. I think I might've had some type of sword/knife/stick that I was using to defend myself, and I may have slashed its head off in the dream, but I don't remember that happening. \n\nI continued to dream that, after I did this, the snake's body continued to lunge at me. The head, separate from the body, also kept moving toward me, somehow moving in a slithering motion, but also bouncing at times. I don't remember if I dreamt it bit me-- I believe in the dream that it either did, or came close. It kept flashing its fangs at me threateningly.\n\nSome context-- I'm a 26-year old male in a graduate program. Recently, I've been struggling after a friend of mine took their own life about a month ago. I wonder if the dream has anything to do with that.

In the dream, this was the second time coming across a similar huge snake (so in total I saw two but not at the same time).\n\nThere was also a crocodile? Alligator? Slowly crawling/moving towards straight to the shore from the shallow waters/sea. But then it suddenly turned to their left &amp; towards us (me and some random people I don‚Äôt know, maybe there were 2-3 of us and a puppy with white fur named ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù). It swiftly attacked and snatched the puppy when it approached our area. The puppy was yelping. We felt helpless but its name ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù kept repeating in my head. ‚ÄúLucky. Lucky. The puppy is lucky!‚Äù So that gave me the courage to help free the puppy from the alligator/crocodile. I told the other people I was with to help so they did. We freed the puppy after I kept hitting the croc/gator and we were forcing its jaws open."

    "body": "As soon as I fell asleep last night, I had an awful dream about my mini dachshund. I dreamed I was walking with her on a bridge we used to walk on in the summers. It goes over the ocean, and it‚Äôs probably 20 feet above the water. I dreamed she somehow fell in and was struggling to swim. I woke up, and as soon as I fell asleep had an almost identical dream, however she was in a fast moving river. We couldn‚Äôt jump in because although it was too deep for her, it wasn‚Äôt deep enough for us to jump from such a high surface. \n\nLater in the night, I had a dream that my tiny indoor cat was hit by a car and passed away. For some reason, all of my childhood cats who had passed away long ago had recently passed in my dream, and I couldn‚Äôt stop crying. \n\nAny idea why I keep having dreams like this?"

And I changed into my gym clothes but then I couldn't find my regular shirt, a grey shirt with the word DORK in yellow letters across the chest (I've been wearing it frequently in my waking life). And we were being timed on something but I basically spent the entire period desperately looking for my shirt instead of focusing on the class. I saw other people wearing similar shirts and asked if they could help, and other people brought me similar shirts but it was never the right one. I recognized some of them I think but I don't remember them. I looked EVERYWHERE 10 times over. And then I went into a room where a girl was cutting up meat with a knife and I held up a chunk of meat and it had my name on it, like a video game item almost, and I was like this is me. This is what happened to my shirt. Turned into meat apparently. And then I held up the knife which also had my name on it and said this is also me, and I looked at the girl and said you were cutting up my flesh with a piece of me. This is why I couldn't find my shirt anywhere. And that's all I remember I think.\n\n\nSeems like something having to do with my identity but... Google didn't help much"

Also I heard this weird clanging, like 2 frying pans or something.  Anyway, I went to the cafeteria for some reason but then all the tables moved to the sides of the room and some blonde little girl (probably around 15) wearing a pink cardigan and beige skirt popped out from an archway that led to the library.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point she mouthed hi then pulled out like a modern pistol and shot at me. (should probably add that I've never seen this girl before). I dodged it and she ran away. I just stood there then she came out the other door that led to the hallway I just came threw. She kept swapping doors for a good 5 minutes then I heard all the faculty yelling. They were all running down the hallway but they weren't able to move past a certain point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a getting shot at a few more times, I picked up a fire extinguisher and used it to block a bullet before throwing at her. She got dazed so I tried to tackle her, but she managed to finally hit me, right in the middle of the tip of my middle finger. I looked at the wound and it was less of a bullet hole and more of a really big pin prick that was bleeding rather fast. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few seconds the blood reached my wrist and I looked to where the girl was, but she wasn't there. Then I looked at the wound again, the blood had reset to just a normal looking streak coming out of the hole. After that it just faded to black and I woke up. No clue what it was about but it was a LOT more lucid and vivid then my other dreams."

    "body": "I‚Äôm not even sure what the best word to describe it is so I‚Äôll just give as much detail as I can and hopefully it makes sense.\n\nThe dream started with me in a room beside a basement (a bedroom not unlike my brother used to have)\n\nAnd basically I was asked not to leave that room.\n\nBut quickly I found myself tormenting by some demonic force that was doing weird things like making faces on the walls and making it appear the door was gone so I couldn‚Äôt leave.\n\nThe details don‚Äôt matter but just keep in mind I was being tormented by this demonic force and it scared me enough I really didn‚Äôt want it to happen again.\n\nBecause that becomes important later.\n\nSuddenly the dream cuts to me sitting side by side with a woman I‚Äôve known since middle school. One of my closest friends and someone I‚Äôve always loved.\n\nSomehow I instinctually knew that on some spiritual level we were (for a lack of a better term) both drawing the same energy.\n\nIf life was some magnetic axis, she and I are both north (or both south)\n\nBoth Yin or both Yang.\n\nAnd for this reason I knew that the two of us being together meant we were drawing in the same type of energy, making it positive, and the demonic force could never return because of this.\n\nThink of it like we‚Äôre slowly building up our ‚Äúki‚Äù and it‚Äôs acting like a force field.\n\nBut not just for stopping evil things but it felt like luck in general.\n\nLike somehow I knew my chances of random bad things happening like stubbing my toe or a tire blowing out all the way up to heart attacks would be lower\n\nAnd random good things like stumbling across a winning lottery ticket would be higher.\n\nI went to pay her some platonic compliment and I felt she took it the wrong way because she responded ‚ÄúI just need more time‚Äù as if she just recently divorced or lost her husband.\n\nAt this point the dream cuts to me walking into the house of a blonde girl that looks like a movie star I‚Äôve always admired, and when she looked her best too.\n\nShe took my hand and introduced me as her boyfriend which thrilled me.\n\nBut then it‚Äôs like a silent narrator just telepathically told me that despite how good she is (physically, mentally, emotionally) something about her (in an almost horoscope bullshit sort of way) meant she was on the other axis.\n\nNot even just neutral but one that would be negative and drain all that good juju I had built up earlier.\n\nRight then I knew if I stayed with her it would be constant misfortune. No chance at the lottery , if anything I‚Äôd get robbed randomly and lose money.\n\nNot because she‚Äôs bad in any way (I can‚Äôt emphasize that enough) but because she just brought bad luck.\n\nSo she tried to lead me up stairs , a moment I‚Äôve probably wished would happen with this actress in dreams for years but all I could think about was that the demon from earlier would pop out at any moment now.\n\nMy protection was gone and would soon become anti-protection (like a beacon for bad things)\n\nBut I wanted to stay with her anyway. \n\nAs I type this the meaning seems almost too obvious. The first girl is the right girl. But can it really be that simple?"

It was so vivid that it has been years and I can't still forget about it.\n\nI was walking in the middle of the street, within the crowd and there was a man following me. Rather than feeling threatened, I felt comfortable and safe instead. I was much older there, around mid-20s. Same for the man who seemed to be in his late 20s. There were stalls at the side and there are some people selling various things like the ones you can see when you go to a night market. Both of us were wearing pants and shirts and he has a clean cut of hair. I had a long straight hair there, my curly hair is inborn.\n\nAnd then, while we were walking, we were just looking around, sight-seeing, having smiles on our lips while enjoying the surroundings. After some minutes, we finally arrived at the destination. It was at the countryside and there was a house made of wood and cement there. The house is built under a huge tree and at the side, you can see the rice fields. \n\nWe went inside the house. It is actually fully furnished but it looked like it was being abandoned after a celebration. You can see the food sitting on the table, untouched. You can see confetti on the floor, the balloons, the decorations still hanged up on the walls. And then, we went inside a certain room and we saw a bunch of baby items like blankets, clothes, etc. In every clothing there, the baby's name is embroidered. The man and I didn't really talk at all, throughout the whole time but when I picked up one of the blankets, we smiled lovingly while looking at the embroidered name.\n\nSometimes, I believe that this man from my dream is actually the right person for me but still, I haven't seen him yet."

We are communicative, understanding and very much in love with each other. Everything feels great with my partner. We connect on every single level. I literally have no complaints whatsoever.\n\nWell.... but there was this dream. In my dream, I found out that my partner had been hiding some crucial information under her bed. I opened her laptop and took a look at some documents. I saw pictures of at least two women that she had killed by drugging them up. The pictures themselves weren't disturbing or violent, they were just normal ID pictures. But there were pills attached to the pictures (inside of little plastic bags) and I just KNEW that they were her victims.\nNext thing I see is my partner entering the room and I pretended to not have seen anything.\nI knew that she was planning to do the same with me eventually. It was her method of killing people: By entering relationships with them and making them feel safe and loved, not thinking anything bad of it all. \n\nI felt so disappointed and betrayed and also fearful..... when I woke up, I couldn't remember the dream at first, but then it hit me. And it's been haunting me the whole day now. I have no idea why I would dream such a thing. I'm not lying to you, I have ZERO negative feelings about my partner. I have no suspicions or anything.

But I have more of a feeling that the pendant was some kind of green color, and it had metal swirls around it, the pendant itself was circular. Now nothing ever happened to me when I held it, but I felt like I had to be it‚Äôs protector, it‚Äôs keeper, because I‚Äôm the hands of everyone else it gave off a really bad vibe of like evil, or angry energy coming off of it. When it was in the hands of those who touched it though, their faces kind of distorted. They went to like a weird shape and than back to a whole new constructed face. They didn‚Äôt look bad or anything, just unrecognizable and like they‚Äôre someone completely new. I‚Äôm the end of this dream I ripped the pendant out of someone‚Äôs hand and kept it myself and said I was gonna take the pendant and put it up in a clear frame, because of the energy the pendant was letting off.

    "body": "Last night I dreamt about being in a place that I‚Äôve dreamt of before, though it was quite a bit different than the last time I dreamt of it. It was a place that I knew to be a really big school with a lay-out too confusing for myself to know go to get around, so it was easy to get lost/lose my bearings. The first time I‚Äôve dreamt of the school, it was a good dream.\n\nAlthough it was a school and had classrooms and a lunch room, it also had multiple different apartment buildings in it. Each apartment had a different lay-out as well as having two ways to get in and out, each leading to a hallway with multiple doors leading to more apartments, or different school rooms. There WAS a way to eventually get outside, but at one outside area you needed a vehicle to bring out out and at another side it was completely fenced in. \n\nThere was a set of twins (male and female), each having their own sword. Their purpose of being there was to protect everyone. \nMy boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) were in a lunchroom, and he grabbed a couple of beverages out of the vending machine and drank them before leaving - I grabbed one beverage out of the vending machine, and before I could open it, the lights went out. \n\n(This next part starts to get kind of graphic, so possible TW)\nI used my phone for a flashlight and found my way out of the room into the hallway and then into an apartment-style room. There I saw the two twins and some other people, but something was corrupting the twins. The twins exchanged their swords with one another and started crying blood before cutting the side of the other‚Äôs neck just enough to bleed. Immediately after, the twins started killing everyone in the room - I was in a bit of shock, but then left the room to run into a different room.\n\nI could hear the door to the room the twins were in open and then close, so I kept running to find the door in the room to bring me into the next one away from them. It was also at this point that I somehow knew that my 5yo son was around somewhere as well, so I was also running to try and find him. \n\nThere was one room I ran into but couldn‚Äôt find the way out of the other side of it, so I hid in a closet. The twins came into the room, and while looking in the bathroom I ran out to a different one. I eventually ran into someone else that was hiding in a closet with my son - he was so terrified that he couldn‚Äôt make a sound but he looked like he was trying to scream - I think he thought I might have been the twins until he realized that it was me instead. \n\nUpon the realization, he clung to me. The woman that was hiding with him said she had found him hiding under a super low shelf - I then asked her if it was super obvious that he was hiding there and she said that she didn‚Äôt realize he was there until he came out once he realized that t was a safe person. I was relieved upon hearing that.\n\nWe knew that we had to keep going to stay ahead of the twins, so we looked for the other door that would lead out. I noticed in the closet there was a little bit of a platform higher up, so. Lifted my son up there, but he was scared saying ‚Äúno, no, no‚Äù - I reassured him we were all going to go together, but that he had to go first and I would follow and the seemed to do the trick.\n\nI went up next, and then the other woman followed. I realized there were dim lights on that we could not turn off and I was worried that we would be found from that alone if we stayed, so I looked around and noticed the closet went further down (but only in this upper part) and that there was a door on the other side. We all went through to find ourselves in another room. We went through quite a few more rooms before coming across one with a lot of other people inside. \n\nEveryone here seemed to be under the impression that they were safe, so they had music playing very loud and were hanging around like there wasn‚Äôt any danger lurking. I put my son up into the top of the closet as it had a deep upper part that went further than the  closet itself before going down and unplugging the music and telling them they were endangering everyone there. They told me to stfu and that they were fine, and then plugged the music back in. \n\nI went into the top of the closet but did not see my son - he was down below looking for me, so I grabbed him and brought him up with me. We then hid in the super far back near the door to the next room. Someone was pacing back and forth in that room, and I woke up as I was going to go through the door to talk to them."

    "body": "Last night, a portion of my dream was devoted to being cut in half.\n\nIf anyone is familiar with the series Chainsaw Man, I was taking the place of the main character Denji. I was running away from a threat with some allies in a metropolitan setting. The threat appeared to be a fairly normal looking young adult woman who appeared to have gone wild and enraged from stress. Her demeanor kind of matched how I've been wanting to vent my anger and frustration internally after how the last couple of years have left me feeling unfulfilled and completely alienated. I can place anger towards others, but I cannot place blame on them or myself for what has happened. I can't hate anyone over it.\n\nThe only thing abnormal about this woman was the immense strength she used with a knife to gruesomely cut diagonally through my torso and right arm, right on through to the person on my left as well. Both of us went down and I was very aware of the fact that my legs were no longer attached to my body.\n\nIn the moment, I was taking in how rough the wounds felt. The woman had mounted over my body to impale me a few, slow times. Despite this, I felt very calm and I did not actually feel in danger at all. It didn't feel like murder. My head on its side against cobblestone could look up to see the woman with a quivering expression of wild anger. Tears rolled down her cheeks, her eyes trying not to cry themselves shut. Strained giggles escaped her between sobs.\n\nI only really sensed a budding empathy for her. As the dream started to wrap up, I felt mostly calm and safe. I knew that in a dream, it was a safe space for these ugly emotions to come out. Though really, I don't got much of my own ideas for why I was cut in half, and I am curious to know what others think of this."

Like, to the point of where I woke up crying because it was so realistic, and I felt like someone had touched me, which triggered me waking up.\n\nIn this dream, I was laying in bed and was awoken by my husband. He said we had to get the kids together and that my MIL was coming over. We had 2 kids with a 3rd on the way. It was so weird to me because I remember so vividly what everyone looked like, the number of light switches by our shared bed (3 on my side, 3 on his), the color of the clothes I was wearing down to the art in the house. I remember what my MIL &amp; my FIL looked like down to their shoes. The conversations that were had, everything. My husband left to go to the store and was in an accident when my FIL showed up to tell me we had to talk about the kids, but that everything was okay and my husband would be back. We lost power in the house and when the power came back, my husband was back but FIL/MIL were gone with the kids. My husband told me everything was ok and that we had the evening to ourselves.

Everyone was having fun and then, he was there, wearing a vestment. The guests from other school arrived and we were instructed to tour them around. While talking to the higher-ups, he suddenly approached me and he was being close. My colleagues were there when they suddenly saw us together. One of my colleagues was his younger sister. His younger sister suddenly shouted, cheering on us because he pulled me closer and held my hand while we were behind the guests. It seemed like she is supportive of what is happening between us and she knew that I had a huge crush on her older brother.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd then, the female guests asked me where the comfort room is, so I brought them there but when I checked it, it was not as clean. I already expected it because it was the school's foundation day and there are lots of guests to use it. When I told this to my longtime crush, he temporarily left to call the attention of the General Services in order to clean it for the female guests. Then, I suddenly saw myself falling down from the second floor of the building. I fell down on the bunch of kids who were being blessed by the priest as they were all having their first communion. I quickly got up and asked them if they are fine and they said they were okay.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI liked this guy since I was in college.

For context: I am 26 years old, female, lesbian, my personality type is ENFJ, and I have borderline personality disorder and ADHD. Background info about my ex is below just in case it's helpful, and I do not have a preferred interpretation method. Thank you to everyone in advance.\n\n*Background on my ex: very short relationship a few years ago that didn't work out, but we eventually became best friends and have been very close for a little over 2 years now. She got back together with a guy she dated for years before me and they're married now. She and I still get physical sometimes (she says her husband is okay with it) and will even pretend to be girlfriends, so sometimes it feels like our relationship and feelings are deeper than \"just friends\".*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn my dream, I was hanging out with my ex at her house and a few random girls we had met at the bar (not girls I know in real life, my brain just made them up). I remember feeling left out and not included for most of the time. She was flirting with these girls and playing with their hair, letting them lay on her, etc. (all stuff that she typically does with me in real life). At one point, my ex asked me to go outside and get something for her (I don't remember what it was), but I went outside and it was dark because it was nighttime. I was looking for the thing she wanted me to get and I came across this snake. It was huge, mostly light green with some large black diamond shapes on it and [looked like this](https://br.pinterest.com/pin/682295412270638671/). Not sure what it actually was, but I knew for a fact it wasn't a local species where I live (Midwest U.S.) I didn't see it at first and startled it, so it hissed at me and started standing up. I backed away and told the snake, \"I'm really sorry, I didn't see you there\" and then it left me alone.\n\nThen, one of my ex's neighbors came over to me and asked me if I wanted him to kill the snake for me. Again, this isn't someone I know, my brain just made him up. I told him no and it was fine, the snake wasn't bothering me anymore and I had just startled it. I kept looking for whatever it was I supposed to be getting, and I found a second snake. This one was a lot smaller, with a brownish-red banding pattern. I'm not sure if it was a local species, but it definitely looked a lot less exotic, [sort of like this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/73683441@N07/16795702747). This time I didn't startle the snake, so we made eye contact but left each other alone and I moved on to keep looking.\n\nAfter that, this big animal that resembled a panda bear came up to me and started nibbling on my hand and grabbed onto me. It was really friendly, but it was very clingy and latched on to me with its arms and would not let go. I remember thinking that it must have been a baby that had lost its mom. I was trying to look it up on my phone to found out what type of animal it was. While I was doing that, my ex came outside to see what was taking me so long and to make sure I was okay. I told her everything that had happened and when I got done explaining, I noticed that the panda-like animal was gone. I also tried to show her the snakes, but I found them both dead on the ground tied up against a spear. The neighbor said he killed them because they were dangerous, but then I got very upset and told him that they weren't bothering anyone, this was their home too, and they didn't deserve to die. After that, my ex and I spent the rest of the dream trying to find the panda-like animal because I wanted to save it."

Could he mean that I actually am on the right path and to just trust in that? But why would he call it the 'map' and not the 'way' if that's the case?

She then tells me that she‚Äôs almost finished with making the medication legal. She then offers me some of the pills. I ask to read the labels but she just laugh at my question. She then tells me to either take the pills or I will get the medicine injected. I start panicking and ask her about the soccer game. She tells me that we will go there when I take the medication. \n\nI try to look for an exit but she just laughs and yet again tells me to take the medication. She then leans down to my ear and tells me that the pills are much, much better than the injections. And that only fools take the injections. She then hands me the packet of pills.

However last after our conversation I had a dream about him in that dream we we were together spending time together and other stuff and there were snakes in this dream and I‚Äôm scared of snakes even when I dream of them however this time around I wasn‚Äôt scared at all even when I woke up. That is what‚Äôs the most weird about this. I don‚Äôt dream about things I obsess over however I dream of this guy what could it mean can anyone help me understand."

And I‚Äôm pretty sure I was in Louisiana even though I‚Äôve never actively been in Louisiana. (I‚Äôve passed through Louisiana once.) I noticed that the trolley lines were intersecting with the regular vehicle lanes, and there were stoplights. \nThe first stoplight, I realized I was breaking too hard and not in time enough and I told myself that I need to pay attention. At the second light, my passenger side got hit with a trolley. I have a very little car IRL but the trolley was more damaged than my vehicle. Before I get out of the car, I noticed that two black, older men were conducting it. One was drinking out of a Bud Light beer can and the other man was smoking a joint. And I asked myself if my insurance good so I started freaking out and trying to find anything to use against the conductors like smoking weed and drinking alcohol while driving the trolley. So I got out and I called my mother and she‚Äôs not paying attention, she‚Äôs cutting me off, she can‚Äôt hear me, every excuse under the sun for her to explain to me at the bare minimum, that she could not grasp what I was trying to ask her. In the meantime, the two men that were conducting, it turned into two very attractive men. So attractive that I got nervous and embarrassed, even more so since I was blocking traffic.\nI got mad, I was scared, and I was trying to experience some intense back pain and started cursing at her and yelling at her, and so forth. And then she had my sister on the phone trying to fuss at me for it. \nI proceeded to tell my sister she‚Äôs the last person to start passing judgment, or pass any advice to anyone on how to do their life or be responsible. I guess we were on FaceTime and I saw that she had a newborn baby girl on her chest. I am a Santa Muerte Devotee, so I started praying to Her to let this be a dream.\n\nIRL: \nI woke up at exactly 0130, on the way to the bathroom I thanked Santa Muerte for letting that being just a dream.\n\nMy mom is not the best person to talk to in emergencies. And the relationship I have with my sister isn‚Äôt perfect (and even recently she tried to belittle me like we‚Äôre children again, even though we are 10 years apart and full grown adults), she has three boys I want to say the youngest is maybe three and she cannot have any more children. \n\nHelp."

    "body": "I am one to believe dreams have meanings but usually don‚Äôt often have nightmares or dreams that are disconcerting enough to care to find out what they mean. However I had a series of nightmares last night which weren‚Äôt entirely all that bad I think just due to a lack of vividness, though they were VERY out of the my dreaming norm and played out as a series of dreams all with the same unnerving theme.\n\nThroughout these dreams I found myself running from a sort of sinister evil or evil spirit that was hunting people down and killing them. The first dream involves me working at some unfamiliar store where people began to die spontaneously on shift but we were expected to stay. Remaining staff and I realized the cause was staring into the reflection of an old TV in the store because when doing so, intense fear and the feeling of an evil presence would wash over you. I don‚Äôt know why but I kept wanting to look into it to figure out exactly what it was and a feeling of impending doom grew each time until I finally sprinted out of the store and ran to my car and sped out of the parking lot like my life depended on it, feeling like if I wasn‚Äôt out of there fast enough, I was next.\n\nSimilar scenarios repeated in smaller dreams I had later on in the night where I kept finding myself wanting to investigate these very malevolent energies coming from reflections.  I think I wanted to investigate both out of curiosity and a hope that it would go away. One small dream involved me looking into the reflection of the sliding glass door in my kitchen and would feel waves of fear wash over me but nothing happened. Another dream didn‚Äôt involve a reflection I recall but involved me being in my house with a coworker of mine and sprinting outside to my car while desperately pleading with this coworker to come outside and get in the car with me all while they were confused and asking my why. One last related one involved my walking down the street past the store from the first dream to see if the evil energy was still there and killing the workers.\n\nFinally, this last one was a little different and didn‚Äôt feel scary to me in the moment but was very creepy and sinister in nature. I was in this very old dingy apartment that was very colorless and filled with dusty sunlight. There were a bunch of friendly but timid monsters living together on this floor I was on. They were all just lifelessly doing nothing while I was desperately searching all the rooms for something. They did not bother me until I opened a door that led to an attic above. As soon as I did all the monsters started fearfully and angrily screaming and yelling NOOO!!! NOO!!! And suddenly blood starts pouring down the stairs and I feel fear wash over me and I sprint outside and begin running from the apartment building. I look back and from a dormer window on the roof I see two creatures watching me, one large and one small- one white with large black voids for eyes and one black with large white voids for eyes. I run as fast as I can but they continue to watch me until finally from a third person perspective I watch my eyes melt out of my head and my body collapse to its knees. It felt like I turned into one of the monsters living in that place.\n\nI don't usually have dreams like this, let alone a series of them all night. I'm mostly unbothered about it but am also very curious what it all could mean if it does mean something. I'm at a relatively good place in life right now and have been doing good inner work so it's not something I would expect to be within me with this sudden intensity at this moment in time. What are your thoughts?"

    "body": "I was 8 or 10 years old (2007-08) when I used to get frequent dreams about a place. So in the dream there is a 4-way rotary intersection with a central island and wide median strip on each way and my dad and I are standing on the left lane of the road whereas my mom and sister are taking the bus on the opposite lane. This is then the dream ends. I've had this same dream for many years when I was child. The intersection looked very beautiful and way too modern for that time.\n\nWhen I turned 18 or so (around year 2015) , I needed to go to a different city for some works with my dad. This is the city which is approximately 60 kms away and I had never been there. So I was driving the car and my dad was sitting on the passenger sit. The road network was in rectangular pattern and after crossing a few intersections, I was right at the same spot I used to get dreams of. It immediately clicked me that I'm on the same lane, and there is this bus coming on the opposite lane and that there is a median in between to separate the opposite traffic. Except that my mom and sister weren't there and they weren't taking the bus, it was me and my dad only there. \n\nBut everything I saw in those dreams happened right back at that time and at that intersection. I was driving my car right at the same spot I was standing in my dreams several years ago. That moment was so crazy at that time that the dejavu lasted for quite a long time until I reached at another intersection."

After a bit, I apologised to them, saying I was really filled with so much emotions + I had a bit of alcohol to drink. I think they forgave me but it was so weird bc they rang everyone‚Äôs phone (the 2000s kinda phones), and they were talking about me. But they were actually saying nice things about me. I felt a bit guilty but also relieved.\n\nFast forward to driving back to the place me and my high school friends were staying at. I was at the back seat and someone else was driving. It was a really clear night but the road was wet (like it just rained) and the moonlight was really bright, reflecting on the wet road. The road was really wide and going straight only. I was a bit worried bc there were a lot of big potholes, some looked like they were really massive deep holes but the car just drove past the holes, barely affected by them.

Kinda fun but I also didn't wanna float away too far incase I never came back, it was as if i knew I couldn't float too far away because something not so nice would happen, but still kinda funky. \n\nI'm not sure when, but then they started to get darker. I'd 'wake up', open my eyes and see something in my room, and I started to feel like I was no longer floating up- but going down. I lived alone and ended up moving house where I live with other people. I thought that would make it go away but it hasn't.\n\nNow I'm not scared of it, but its more of an annoyance. I go to sleep, I wake up and I just start dream-punching whatever shadowy figure is beside me until I wake up. The imagined presence doesn't feel like some sort of evil entity, but it's also not very comforting? And it also doesn't feel like the same 'presence' each time. I just don't feel like watching me sleep is a very cool thing to do so like, get out of my house. Last night, it felt as if I was slowly being sucked off my bed and vacuumed downwards. I can always wake myself up by shadowboxing air. Maybe it's sleep paralysis, but why it happens every night I'm not sure. I have a certain trick to get rid of it, and if I do that before bed I never get those dreams- but I'm not always in the mood every single night if you get me\n\nAlso, the dreams never happen if there's someone else physically in my room, like if I'm babysitting a cat or get lucky enough to bring someone home one night.\n\nBut who the hell am I fighting in my sleep?"

My hair and makeup was done but I didn‚Äôt have my dress on yet. He told me ‚ÄúI thought you could use some flowers‚Äùand gave me purple and yellow tulips wrapped in brown paper.

I distinctly remember seeing him for the first time because we were both at a banquet. I was there to take photos and when I got up and walked over I stopped right in front of his table. I looked up and we locked eyes. I remember thinking how cute he was and feeling intrigued by him. Then I seen him again at an event soon after - no introductions yet - but heavy attraction still/eye contact. Several months later ,I saw him again at a large parade where I remember locking eyes intensely through a huge crowd again. A couple of months after that he randomly ended up working for my former boss. We then met and the energy was intense. But nothing came of it and we haven‚Äôt come in contact since. I also learned that he might have a girlfriend.\n\nI should mention that I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, but I‚Äôve been very open lately to share space with someone else. A while back I also went to a psychic (lol) and he told me a would meet a soulmate from a past life between the ages of 25-27.\n\nI might be going crazy, these could just be coincidences, or they might be signs. Am I reading into things too much? What do you think. Let me know if I can elaborate on anything. Your help and insight is greatly appreciated."

Especially if you have dreamed about dying before, or even if you had a near death experience, thank you in advance-and I look forward to receiving any sort of feedback„Äã\n\n‚Ä¢My dream starts off with me and my mother sitting in a room, talking on the bed. I then fall off the bed and get some sort of head injury. I begin screaming for my mom, but she walks away to get someone else. I then starting puking this clear liquid, that was causing me issues to breath. She comes back and say \"just breathe\" then she gets on the phone to call my grandma and uncle to give us a ride to the hospital. Well they started arguing, then my mom gets mad and says forget it she's not going to help. I then remember trying to stumble out of the room- but I was unable to see properly. Like my vision was of me in some sort of dark hallway with multiple doors and stairs. I was still calling out to my mom with no help or answer. Somehow I make it outside and cops appear, and so does my mom . At this time, she appears concerned talking about \"someone help her , my baby\" It changed to me in the hospital, in a surgery room. I was awake, and the doctor put some sort of iv into my side/abdominal area. I remember that my brain had a infection, and they was trying to pump antibiotics directly into my stomach. \nThen very vividly-like this felt so real. I started puking, and choking on my own blood. I remember in the dream I felt very fearful but I was trying to stay calm and breath. Like, I felt my \"light\" fading out. I really felt death creep up, slowly. I had enough time to acknowledge the fact that I was dying, and to be scared. Briefly I tried to fight it, then I accepted-even said a small prayer to God something like \"Forgive me father, and if this is my time I accept this. Take me\" once that was said I \"fell unconscious\" in my dream and saw some sort of light. A beautiful welcoming light, i felt a sense of peace, love and longing. Like I really wanted to go, fully ready to set life aside and move on to the light. Once my \"soul\" begin leaving from my body, the dream ended and I woke up. I was very confused, and sad that I was not able to reach the light. Like my first thought was \"I wanted to go\" \n\nI'm not really sure the meaning or message of this dream,but I cannot emphasize enough on how real everything felt. When I was choking I really felt like I was losing my breath. When I was \"dying\" - I really believe I felt the presence of Death itself. Seriously, I woke up sad that I didn't die for real? How strange is that?\n\nAnyway, thank you for taking your time reading this. If you have any insights, or interpretations please leave a comment. I'd love to see how other people see the meaning behind this, or have experienced something similar."

At some point I go up to the ice, take out my large knife and plunge it straight into the ice, causing a North Star shaped hold to appear who's four points extend out for miles, basically cutting the lake into four sections with a brilliant North Star at the center. I immediately sense great danger is coming. I know that a legendary great white shark, one that's been threatening yet eluding my family for generations, is about to come out of the center of the hole. I call out to my family for help, but they're too distracted on their phones to notice or care. I'm terrified, realizing I'm  gonna have to face the shark alone and hold it off by myself until I can knock some sense into my family. The shark is now taunting me, it knows I'm alone and afraid and is basically just toying with me now, throwing insults, knocking me up and down. I manage to stab it a few times, and it manages to sink its teeth into my leg. I run away, but it makes its way onto land and I'm now playing hide and seek with it hoping it doesn't find me. I muster some bravery, and I succeed in confronting the shark and cutting it up into pieces, half its body still submerged in the waters right where the hole is. I keep telling my family, \"look! Look! The great white shark we've been trying to kill for generations is *right there!* why won't you help?\" They finally listen and come to the hole, but at this point the shark has already run off, though I get the sense it's only been temporarily defeated. I then lecture my family about not being distracted on their phones and taking me seriously when I cry for help, because though I successfully fended off this one, more sharks are soon to come."

Once I did he dug his chin deep into my lower to mid spine and I got paralyzed.

    "body": "I once had a (non lucid) dream which started with me flying a biplane, by myself, from the hangar near my home. I did half of a barrel roll then slipped out of the plane and plummeted to the ground far below, but I did not hit the ground. I suddenly found myself in a small white room with a kids table and chairs, there were some cubbies on the wall and a tall dark entity in the corner. This was many years ago and I don't remember much else.\n\n\nMore recently, only a year or two ago, when I was really into lucid dreaming I dreamt that I woke up from a foreign bed in a stained-wood room. When I was able to detach from my physical body and move freely in the dream I left the room and found a stone hallway that lead to an open area. Directly in front of thw hallway was a large opening that revealed I was in a carved-out cave. To the left there was what felt like a kitchen. To the right there was an open area that was not lit by thw outside light and was very dark. It was epecially dark behind a stone pillar where I felt a presence. The presence stepped into the light and was my grandmother, this is when I fully realized I was in a dream, and the excitement woke me up. Eager to continue the expeince I went back to sleep, but I did not find myself inside the cave with my grandma. This time I was fully lucid inside an office building. I explored a bit and found an opening that met with a yellow lake. There were mountains off to the right. Above to the left there was a bridge-like structure so I spider-man swung up to it. I dipped into the waters and saw that from below/within it was a mucky brown-yellow, unlike the lovely golden surface. I felt like a see monster was gonna get me so I got above the bridge as quick as possible. The waters washed away the control I normally have in a lucid dream but I still remained quite conscious as I landed on the structure and found a large metal clearing with a small black pyramid a hundered or so meters away that had golden markings in a language I do not know. I found myself directly in front of the pyramid and felt the presence of a tall entity behind me (I don't remember seeing them but in my mind they ooked like Anubis). This being wordlessly communicated to me that their world was in danger and the moon was needed to save them, then the clouds dissipated enough for a giant moon to shine it's brilliance on the pyramid and it's golden writings started glowing blue. Then the glowing stopped as the moon was again covered by clouds. Had I remembered that I was dreaming I would've moved the clouds myself (I've done so before, pulling clouds together and darkening them to conjure lightning, I assume I could pull them apart too) so the best thing I could think to do was call on the Greek goddess of the moon, Artemis. When I shouted her name I felt what I could only describe as a ripple across realms. Then I was ripped from that world and into a grey-white limbo where I felt like I was falling in multiple directions while myriad voices were talking angrily but I couldn't hear them, not until one said \"you are the worst of us\" then I woke myself up bc that sh*t was terrifying...\n\nI'd love to hear some interpretations of what these dreams may have meant!"

I'm gingerly walking around body parts of other female victims when I hear him walking.  I see a hole in the floor and lower myself into a stank, wet area and I see him walk by.  \n\n2nd- I'm an apartment decorated all in white.  I see a woman with long super straight blond hair, also dressed in white walking around completely straight face.  No emotion.  She's with another women who looks like that.  They're flirting or interacting bizarrely.  One is lying down and the other is touching her face with her foot (toes).  As I hide behind a pillar/wall, I see they've swapped places and now the other women does the same, but this time the woman instead of caressing her with her foot, she steps on her face.  Her face completely caves in.  While this is happening, I see the front door has been left open, so I book it and run as fast as I can.  \n\nBoth dreams definitely left me feeling so dark and uncomfortable."

  },
  {
    "body": "Key word \"loosely\".  It's on the general design of player characters and their general culture that carried over into the dreams.  Everything else was different\n\nThe game these dreams were drawing from is this one.  [Sky: Children of the Light](https://youtu.be/aBQRCHusYyU)\n\nThere were a lot of differences in the dream though.  For example, in the game, while you can swim under water as a secondary mechanic, it's jenky and you have a limited oxygen supply and the main emphasis in the game is on the flying mechanics instead.\n\nIn my dream, it was the opposite.  Yes, I was my in game character, but it was a world where the sky people were largely amphibious.  Even though we could go above land or even fly if they wanted to, we needed to be underwater to truly flourish\n\nI first caught a glimpse of this world in another dream a few nights ago.  I was living in an underwater city with a gamified version of my family.  But I came up to the surface one morning and noticed off in the distance, miles away, what looked to be a beautiful stone mansion on a hillside at the top of a ravine that we were in the middle of\n\nI asked my dad about it and he told me to stay away from that place.  He said that those were invaders who had drained most of the water in the valley which had once been a large river and the we were left with only a fraction of our original territory as a result.\n\nHe warned me never to go near them.  Said they were hostile and hated us.  He said they were scared of us because of our mobility as the only known race who could swim, fly, and run with ease.  They thought we could ambush them at any time and they wouldn't be able to defend themselves\n\nI thought that was ridiculous because we were a pretty peaceful race (look at the game Sky for reference.  It was practically the same thing).  So when nobody was looking I decided I wanted to go talk to them, and took off on the long flight across the ravine\n\nAnd that's where the first dream ended.\n\nOh, and did I mention the \"invaders\" were humans?  That seems pretty important\n\nSo last night's dream seemed to pick up where the first one left off.  Actually, I think I might have even skipped over some stuff because it started inside the mansion with no context for how I got there or how the people living there initially reacted when I showed up\n\nAll I knew was that I shouldn't be there and was desperate to get out\n\nAnd while there were people in the mansion, all dressed in formal wear and drinking martinis, they weren't actively screaming or throwing things at me or anything extreme.  Instead, they all just gave me \"the look\".  You know the one.  That hateful death glare you'd shoot at someone when you're barely tolerating their presence and want them to just leave ; a barely contained rage seething just beneath the surface, threatening to boil over\n\nEventually, I got to what must have been the mansion's front entrance because I saw something that took my breath away\n\nI saw a large dam miles tall and even further in with, and beyond it, an endless expanse of ocean.  I could have just dived into all that water and never looked back; freer than I'd ever been\n\nBut I couldn't\n\nMy family was in the opposite direction.  And if I went out that way, I'd likely never see them again\n\nSo, reluctantly, I had to turn back.  I had to go back through the mansion\n\nLuckily, it had one of those main foyer type of setups where the front and rear exits are essentially connected by a long hallway with rooms branching off.  So it didn't take long to find the exit\n\nI ran out onto the patio dived straight into some water, thinking in the moment that I was home free.  I gulped in lungfuls of water with the same eagerness that you might when coming up for air after swimming.  It was a beautiful place with lots of colorful coral and sunlight refracting onto the bottom\n\nBut that moment was short lived\n\nTurns out it was only a retention pond.  And as I begrudgingly crawled up the rocky shore on the other side, I found, to my dismay, a large brick wall, at least two stories tall, separating the mansion from what lay beyond it.\n\nI would have just flown to the top, but I was too wore out.  My wings didn't work.  So I had to climb up.\n\nIt took ages and it hurt a lot.  But eventually, I made it to the top.  And on the other side, I found that same ravine from the first dream.\n\nThe small lake my family lived in was miles away; nothing but a pitiful creek at the bottom on the way there.  And I couldn't fly anymore.  So I knew I had a long, difficult journey ahead of me\n\nThen I woke up\n\nDISCLAIMER: If this came off as long winded or disjointed.  I'm sorry.  I just woke up and I needed to get this out of my head while it was still fresh\n\nEDIT: Also, I don't know if it matters, but [this is what my game character looks like](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/902562752734842961/1108404748551462973/SKY_20230506_185844_.jpg) and it's more or less how I looked in the dream too"

Before I walked in I turned back to the ladies and asked if they could help me. One of them said \"but you've already begun\". That's when I realized the image of what I could see in the doorway was burned into my eyes. And it only went back to normal if I was looking into that room. So I walked in and my vision was normal again.\n\nThe room was a large horizonal cylinder with computer monitors on each end and along the sides. \n\nThe room also glowed with blue lights. It looked like a mash up of futuristic and spiritual. \n\nThere was something I had to find to get out of the room. Somehow I instinctively knew I had to pick up one of the monitors and move it around. All the information on the screen changed when I moved it. It was identical to one of those 360 pictures where you move your phone to see all around you.\n\nEventually I matched up the monitor with whatever it was I needed to. \n\nThen I went out of the room and I was at a staircase. I had to race someone up the stairs. They were wooden stairs.\n\nI began to run up the stairs and there was a trail of candy all the way up the stairs. I couldn't help but eat the candy as I was running up them. \n\nI finally reached the top and asked the other person why they went a different way but they didn't answer. \n\nI woke up shortly after."

The dreams range from pleasant to scary to anxiety producing. I don‚Äôt remember them really but he would usually support me or help me fix the in-dream problem.\n\nI first met this guy was the summer before 6th grade at a camp we went to. I definitely thought he was cute, and was absolutely floored when I passed by him in the school hallway a couple months later. Throughout middle school I developed a crush that I would like to think was similar to crushing on your favorite celebrity in the sense that I knew there was no way in hell I stood a chance, but I couldn‚Äôt stop admiring him for his personality, smarts, and looks. I was always nervous to not appear stupid if he was around and was actively trying to be quieter when I‚Äôm usually pretty up-beat. \n\nIn high school there were a few classes we had together, and I would always have the feeling he would be glancing at me. I‚Äôd catch him looking away (because of course I would be glancing at him every now and then) and I even did the yawn test just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt overthinking it. He yawned. Despite all of this, we had different friend groups, never spoke to each other unless we had to, and I still dated other people. I don‚Äôt believe he ever dated anyone until college. Both of our families go to the same synagogue and my dad and his dad are friends. \n\nI can‚Äôt remember when the dreams started but they were a lot more frequent than they are now. At first I just thought it was a one-off but it‚Äôs been 4 years since I‚Äôve seen him in person and I‚Äôm in a different state because of school. He is also currently in a relationship but I‚Äôve been so busy focusing on myself that I haven‚Äôt given him the time of day. I keep telling myself that I‚Äôm just overthinking everything, but the fact that he specifically has been more reoccurring than people who have hurt me or even those I cherish just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. Does his reappearance in my dreams actually mean anything? Am I suppressing feelings? Or am I just overthinking it?"

After some time, I go inside the barn and I find lots of people who were drinking, doing drugs and partying whilst lights shined around and music played in the background, but that's not what surprised me the most, because there was a pale young lion sitting near 2 wooden poles looking back at me, it didn't seem like it wanted to harm me so I get a bit closer so that I can see it in case it decides to pounce at me while I'm distracted or something.\n\nSome time goes by and people start putting on louder music and start jumping around, this makes the lion uncomfortable, resulting in him standing up and walking away from his spot, but whilst he strides forward, his paw meets with a woman's foot and his claws sink into it, causing her to scream in pain. This makes everyone briefly stop and then start screaming and running around, while makes the lion when more scared, resulting in him biting the people who come close to him defensively. \n\nI don't know what's the meaning of this dream but I'm sure it has something to do with responsibility. I don't wanna sound like one of those annoying people that bug people who smoke or drink but the people at the party were clearly indulging recklessly, something not very responsible, and the lion also was not restrained in any way, he wasn't in a cage or with a leash tying him to those poles, he was completely free and able to do whatever he so desired to do. I think that the lion represent the responsibility (or lack thereof), once the people began to do all kinds of irresponsible things, the lion grew more and more agitated, and when the breaking point happened, he completely lashed out at everyone. \n\nWhat do you guys think this could possibly mean?"

Also, I realize lions mane causes nightmares I won‚Äôt be taking it at night anymore, but still, I‚Äôve recently read nightmares are the brains way to cope with trauma. So, with that being said I was ok with it happening eventually. \n\nFirst the dream started off as a NSFW dream w/ my girlfriend, there is definitely lead up to the second part, but I don‚Äôt recall, (I absolutely know there was more in between, but absolutely nothing is recalled, up until the nightmare, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve experienced that before).\n\nNow, I was with my boys and girl, we called into a haunted house to go visit it, we set reservations. When we got there, nobody took are tickets at the door, it was just open and nobody there. We went in and we were giggling and thought it was funny and waiting for a jump scare, although, nothing was happening so we got confused and a little creeped out. It was a dark, cold and empty house. \n\nWe decided to go upstairs, I walked into the bathroom and before I even got in I saw a extremely tall, skinny, lengthy man who looked like he hadn‚Äôt eaten in years. All I remember seeing was his foot which was extremely bruised, but somehow I know exactly what he looked liked without even looking at his whole body. Weird I know.  \n\nHis face looked like the rake, but I didn‚Äôt see it visually I just knew, it‚Äôs confusing, but yeah. I slammed the door shut and freaked the f*** out I told everyone and we realized we probably should get the hell out and this wasn‚Äôt what we thought. We ran to the door and everything closed, everything. Windows locked, doors locked, everything immediately as we attempted to escape. \n\nWe then heard the man climbing around in the ceiling like an extremely loud spider. My buddy Jeff decided to get out on the outside patio which wasn‚Äôt unlocked, although somehow we all knew we weren‚Äôt allowed to leave, but he tried anyway. When outside the patio it was gated and he jumped off which was literally a small 3 foot drop maximum, and he immediately broke apart, legs amputated, arms still intact to his torso blood everywhere. \n\nWhat really bothered me was he was still alive and was attempting to scoop his organs and intestines back into his stomach and get his legs back. He was screaming and yelling help me! \n\nWe called the cops, (not when we were locked in a house with spider-demon-man, but when are friend fucking exploded into a million pieces, I know, I guess horror movies and dreams follow the same rule, being dumb). \n\nThey came and he was asking them for help cause he was still alive and they just threw him to the side where there was another mysterious dead body. Then I woke up with the worst derealization and anxiety, but yeah, anybody think there is any meaning? \n\nMy home life hasn‚Äôt been the best lately and I‚Äôve been going through a lot of stress, also sorry for the long ass wall of text, this just helped me to journal it, thanks for reading!"

A ‚Äúchild‚Äù comes into the room that we‚Äôre in and starts acting ‚Äúpossessed‚Äù and I stare at it and then it walks away. It had grey eyes.

I don‚Äôt really post on Reddit communities of any sort but I‚Äôm getting a little desperate as these dreams are reoccurring and messing with me during the day. \n\nFor the past two weeks I‚Äôve had essentially the same dream over and over again with the same person. Last nights dream was the first time it progressed but they usually just consist of me reuniting with an ex. We are no contact and I had only thought of them occasionally when things remind me of them, but as of late it is a constant. Since the dreams started I‚Äôm in my head thinking that it could be them manifesting a reunion or if it‚Äôs me and I was just wondering if there was a deeper meaning. I don‚Äôt go to sleep with the goal of seeing them, I just want to sleep but they end up there anyways. I also considered it being the environment I was in but I came back home and it‚Äôs still happening. Any help or insight is appreciated! Thank you so very much"

Shortly afterwards, one of my friends from middle school came and sat next to me and said he was mad at me for being dramatic, this actually happened in real life too when I was that age and I guess it really hurt my friend anyways, so then I was suddenly adult me and I said I‚Äôm sorry I acted that way towards you, what can I do to fix it? And then dream over. Afterwards I had a lot of emotions come up when I woke up, some of them sad. \n\n\nIn my second dream, my ex from high school came up to me and she was trying to hangout with me and talk to me and then her new husband came up and she started to immediately give me back keepsakes from our relationships like notes, a bracelet, things like that, her husband was getting antsy and so I tried to smooth things over and say let‚Äôs all be friends but I could tell even though my ex wanted to her husband didn‚Äôt like the idea. I started getting the feeling that her husband was really controlling and I kept trying to figure out a way to help her in my dream. That dream made me miss her and worry about her. Our relationship is long over but she was a key person in my life who I wouldn‚Äôt be me without. Both of these dreams have left me reeling a bit emotionally.

    "body": "My dream starts with me gardening vegetables and fruit at my moms house where i used to live. There's this cardboard box I have with an asparagus shoot flowering in some soil. I put clothes in it for some unknown reason, but I remember they were clean clothes and not dirty clothes. I beat myself up about it and my step-dad says it's okay. Its during the time my mom serves dinner, and there's only enough food left for me and none left for my step-dad. I tell him 'here you can have the rest'. He says thank you and I choose to go without. It's a warm feeling.\nWell, cut to a scene the next morning, I notice shoots of asparagus growing out of my back! Three of them, and they're all flowering like the same one I was growing. I started freaking out and asked my Unphased parents if I should remove them myself. My mom said No because they would leave big open wounds that would get infected. I said You're Right. I begged my mom to take me to the hospital so I can get them removed. She ended up taking me, and they suggested taking me to a Special Hospital as this was a Special Case that doesn't happen everyday.\nI go up the stairs and my mom guides me to walk to the door in front of me. I walk through, and she immediately closes the door behind me. I try to open it but it won't open, I try to bang on it to have someone open it from the other side, no luck. \nI was scared and panicky. Inside was a waiting room with alot of windows with sun and plenty of chairs. There were two guys about my age (I'm going to be 23 here in a few days) who were sitting together in the corner not saying anything. They just looked at me as I sat there and made me feel uncomfortable. They got up and sat closer to me. They looked mentally unstable. I got up and moved away from them, playing musical chairs. Then they got up and moved closer to me again. At this time I told them I didn't feel comfortable and I'd just like to sit alone please. They didn't answer and I got up and decided to walk around to see if they followed. They followed me and looked like they were going to hurt me. I walked fast and noticed  the back office where a bunch of women were working with medications and documents and computers, and went into their area saying these 2 were going to hurt me. They didn't seem to care, and one of the guys ended up tackling me down, cutting my airway to breathe. I kept trying to scream saying I can't breathe I can't breathe, I'm going to die, I'm dead. One of the ladies there nonchalantly helped him off me and told them not to do it again. I was questioning why they didn't take it more seriously. The guys left me alone but were close by. I walked within the back office to try to be safe if anything happened. The 2 guys ccame in again and I was walking away from them as they followed me . They kept following me and I asked the ladies if this was normal and why they weren't doing anything. I then find another patient in the back office like me who kind of signals he's been going through the same thing but it is what it is. They medicate him and he just has to deal with it. \nI confront the girls and ask why they don't help the issue. One of the boss ladies insinuates that the two guys' family owns the hospital and they are being paid to let them do whatever they want. I spoke out against it and said it wasn't right and how your letting them control how you do your job and knowingly hurting people instead of helping. \nIt was then one girl came up behind me and syringed my foot with some sort of tranquilizer thing and I faded out.\nI woke up there in the same spot again and went in and said the same thing. How they are knowingly hurting people under their control. As I said it the second time,  I can see 2 or 3 girls side with me. However the bosses didn't like that and they said they weren't going to listen to me anymore and basically to syringe me again. One of the girls who was siding with me got the syringe but gave me a look and was reluctant. I said I don't need this to get better, I just need these plants out of my back so I can go home.\nThen I woke up. \n\nIn real life, I've just taken up gardening for the first time and am obsessed with growing my plants. Also, I just had asparagus for dinner last night but I don't live at my parents house. I've actually been living with Mt fiance in our own apartment for the last 2 years. Also, I am taking prescription drugs right now for depression and anxiety, but I've always felt they were a dead end and weren't fixing a problem. I felt that they couldn't fix my mood swings problem and that I actually have to work on that myself- no medication could fix it. \n\nSo please share with me what you think this dream is trying to tell me, thank you :)"

He is scary and unhinged.

It was a small town, I think. We're in a kitchen and he's playing around with something. Two kinds of flammable chemicals like gasoline and hairspray. There are people working in the background and kids playing. My kids are upstairs. I told him to stop playing around. He ignored me (he knows best, you know the type) then decides to bring out a lighter. I decide it's time to get my kids and get out of there. As I walk past, The aerosol he had sprayed catches fire igniting both myself and the gasoline on the floor. I am desperately trying to get out and do the whole stop drop and roll thing.

When I got closer and crouched down next to them to take a closer look he looked me straight into my eyes and told me that the baby died, and I just let out this blood curdling scream out that I actually felt it in my throat, which caused me to wake up.

I had my dog with me. The house was exactly as I remember it when I was a kid. I was walking into the living room at near dark, there was a man walking up the long gravel road to the back door. He wasn't and still isn't familiar in anyway. I remember he knocked on the door then rang the doorbell while I hid. It felt instinctual that I hide. My dog was barking and I became worried that the man would think the house was empty, and open to being robbed. So, I went to the door and cracked it. I made up a lie, \"my dad and brother's are just upstairs, cleaning their guns.\" But he had this wide grin as I said goodbye and shut the door. I think he was looking for directions he said. It's  close to bed time now and I have a vivid memory of this fist punching straight through the glass window by the door. I tried to get away but I couldn't. I don't have a memory of dreaming of the assault, but I know he raped me in the dream.\nThen I woke up, screaming and crying in my own bed, running to my mom.

As I lag there I could hear / see the coke dealer outside with another, both are dressed in tracksuits and are faceless. I know they are planning to Rob me, and can see one pulling out a knife.

I picked him up and started caring for him, getting him food, petting him, etc. And then another slightly bigger wolf/dog but still an adolescent walked in and I began caring for him too. I went into the kitchen to get them some water but when I turned around the dogs and my brother were gone. I asked my parents where the dogs were and my parents said \"(Brother's name) took them outside.\" I went outside, and he had this trash bag with them inside, and he started smashing it against the ground and he just looked at me and shrugged. I ran inside to tell them and I don't remember exactly what it was they said. It was something of a mix between the lines of 'It was going to happen' and 'Why did you get attached?' I began sobbing uncontrollably and I felt so useless I fell to the ground screaming \"Why didn't you warn me?\" over and over\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter that, I woke up but I was still dreaming and then I woke up for real (I hope). Any interpretation helps! Please ask me if you want to hear about any major life events/random events that have happened recently if that will give a deeper insight."

The dream began with a stranger intruding through the window of my room and started attacking me with a drill, I forcefully grabbed them and chanted ‚Äú*Om Mani Padme Hum*‚Äù ‚Äî A mantra I often use in my daily life and I overpowered them and they disappeared. My hand, or finger tips were stained black. I looked underneath my bed and there were various rainbow clutter that appeared there, the bed was in a different place in my room. Then I ran down to my front room, and my mother was on her phone and I asked her what news she was reading ‚Äî a controversial topic on the 14th Dalai Lama and a prophecy that he would step down, she also made a weird chanting noise. I said to her, it was written by a monk that didn‚Äôt like him. Then I saw a crowd of monks wearing orange robes jumping into a river. Then I returned back to the room, someone came through the door and tried to attack me with a screwdriver, I chanted again and then I woke up.

The feeling of the tower was like wax.\n\nSuddenly, the tower starts collapsing in towards me.  That‚Äôs were I lost control of the dream. As suddenly I‚Äôm stuck and only have a small second so realize, that everything around me has caught fire. Then I black out.\n\nIt‚Äôs instantly I find my little brother uncovering me under the tower. Along with him is my dad. They are relived they have finally found me. I had missing for some time and was probably under a coma until they found me. As I walk out of the tower room I find myself in a bathroom.\n\nThe bathroom has 7 sinks. In a pink gift bag by the sinks I find a card\n\n ‚Äú(cousins name) \n\nSink 1 : trip and fall\n\nSink 2: choke \n\nSink 3: (don‚Äôt remember)\n\nSink 4: earthquake\n\nSink 5: (don‚Äôt remember)\n\nSink 6: fire \n\nSink 7: fall of tower\n\n(My name ) will die this way‚Äù\n\nSo in this card inside a bag by the sinks was √° curse by my cousin on me‚Ä¶\n\nI was saddened by this and I decided to keep it to myself. As I‚Äôm walking out of the school, I get pulled into a modeling course, I meet very beautiful women and we model dresses.. then I feel weird and walk out of the room. \n\nIn the hall a siren goes off, I try to run because I think it‚Äôs a fire siren, but then a girl next to me shouts to get down because it‚Äôs a earthquake siren.\nA younger girl next to me it‚Äôs struggling so I try my best to use my body to shelter her as the world around us shakes. \n\nAfter the quake I run out as fast as I can to find my car.  \n\n\nThat‚Äôs all.\n\nHow did I lose control?\nWhy does this green tower always appear?\nWhy do bathrooms have some weird appearance with the tower, in my dreams?"

When I sleep in my room here I have some pretty scary nightmares that are usually lucid, and end with sleep paralysis. I don't get that when I sleep anywhere else though. But, here's the dream (I \"wake up\" multiple times but at no point was I actually awake):\nI was downstairs in my room and my mom came down and got upset at me about something and then walked back upstairs and I just went back to sleep then I woke up again and I had anxiety and asked her to sit with me, and she told me that we are going to New York this weekend for my birthday and I said I can't because I have to work.\nI then started to realize that I was dreaming and as soon as I did I was teleport to a dark street next to a pier, where a smaller creature (looked like Doby from Harry Potter kinda) was waiting for me and it basically said that he has been waiting for me and will kill me. Then it got even darker and I saw dark figures slicing through the darkness around me, until they started to strike me with glancing blows. When I started trying to fight back the small creature said \"vou will never win like this is not a fight of physical power but a war within the mind\" so I took a deep breath and began to explode the monsters and with my hits they would explode with a little bit of light. after I killed all of them i walked to the little creature and put my hands on his head and watched him explode lighting up the street in golden hour light. then woke up in my bed(not realizing in my dream my room was not correctly set up) and went upstairs to see my family who was all in the living room, packed and ready for New York telling me it was time to go.\n\nI just woke up and wrote this it is now about 3 and I woke up from this an hour ago.\n\nI really hope someone is able to bring some interpretation to this and I‚Äôm interested in what people think it could mean.

Her eyes still amazingly silver but they‚Äôre filled with tears and pain, she‚Äôs wincing. \r  \nI approach and say. ‚Äúbreathe ( gesturing nose first and out the mouth) you need to breathe. Do it with me‚Äù (still gesturing) and the brunettes surround the blonde and I, in a hugging circle, and they‚Äôre helping to get her breathing under control. She‚Äôs got it down and it has seemed to work.\r  \nThen the blonde comes in to me and kisses me. THE most passionate kiss I have ever had (topping real life experiences) this lasted about 10-15 seconds. \r  \nI Awake. And I cant go back and see the rest of this out because I awoke 7 minutes before my alarm.\r  \nIt pains me that I cant. I just don‚Äôt understand any of it, but I want back in."

We were trying to find time to hang out with each other but we were preoccupied with our parents and couldn‚Äôt make it work.

I feel my mood at the time was cheeky and careless and I did not care about letting the horse loose. It quickly escalated and as I began to feel remorse and panic at the horse running and neying? Whatever noise horses make the sky grew red and black and the horse grew in size and then thunder and lighting was clashing and I could hear screaming from other people and the lightning started fires and the situation went cataclysmic almost with the horse being about as big as a school bus up on its hind legs with lighting flashing behind it and then I guess I was finally startled enough to wake up.\n\nJust looking for a analysis from a someone with alot of experience.

At the far end under the lights was this vaguely human like figure that has a slightly larger head and pitch black eyes. There was no skin just muscles, veins, blood and ligaments with the guts partially missing and hanging out. I would twitch at times and chew it's angular fingers. Every time I would blink in my dream I would hear it's blood covered body slosh closer and closer to me with a dripping hand swaying towards me.

    "body": "So, just as I fell asleep I remember getting out of a car with a person whose face I do not remember very well. We were getting out of a car which had stopped at the edge of a forest, and for some reason we decided to wander in.\r  \n\r  \nWe walked for a decent amount of time until the weather started to get cloudy, and the enviroment got darker and more eerie... Suddenly, we got scared by a loud noise coming from all directions; we look up and see some kind of dark giants with very slender and large limbs, a very flat body and a square head with some kind of antenna or something sticking out at the top of their head (almost like a square building with an antenna).\r  \n\r  \nThere were a lot of those things, so we decided to run as fast as we could to a place with more trees in hopes that they couldn't see us anymore, but after some minutes of running, we encountered a simple house, which was in the middle of a decently-large portion of grass with no trees surrounding it. We ran towards it to get away from the dark giants looming in the forest, and surprisingly, we got in the house with no complications...\r  \n\r  \nInside, a couple of old ladies told us that they welcomed us, and that they were sorry for all we went through, apparently they had some kind of magic wand / rod / stick which made wonders for them and it controlled everything in the forest. They told us that they could even create people with the stick and controll them to do their bidding, but unfortunately some had defects and had to be killed. \r  \n\r  \nThe old ladies told us that we were allowed to wander around the house, as long as we wouldn't go too deep in it. I wondered what they meant until I looked back: this simple and small house was suddenly a humongous labyrinth in which all rooms seemed similar, and yet, different from each other.\r  \n\r  \nWe walked through the house for a while and talked about the stick that supposedly controlled everything. We decided to break it, because we thought that these old ladies were doing something that was morally wrong, although right now as I'm typing this I'm still wondering if that was the right thing to do...\r  \n\r  \nWe found ourselves in a room with the stick resting above a silver plate just as we were finished talking, so I went over to it, grabbed it and snapped it in two with my hands. It felt like snapping a twig in a park. Suddenly afterwards, we heard a loud noise coming from outside, and through a window we saw that the giants were starting to collapse and fall, and the house was suddenly filled with the screams of the old ladies.\r  \n\r  \n\"WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!\" Was all we could hear, along with some screams which we didn't know if were made because of anger, fear, pain or a mixture of all.\r  \n\r  \nA door appeared beside us, and we went through it to get out of the house. It was still cloudy, but the enviroment regained a bit of its colour back now that the giants were falling. We didn't care for it, though, as we only cared for getting out of there as fast as possible.\r  \n\r  \nWhen we thought we were getting closer to the edge of the forest, from where everything had started, my companion looked back and asked me if I remember what the old ladies said. When I asked them about what they meant, they said that the old ladies affirmed that they could control other people to do what they wanted. I nodded, and my companion pointed back in resonse to my answer.\r  \n\r  \nJust as I turned around I screamed, a man I had never seen before was up in my face with a crazed look in his eyes. It was almost as if he wasn't a man anymore, but rather a fierce animal who had lost all trace of humanity.\r  \n\r  \nHe grabbed me by my shirt with one hand and pulled out a knife with the other. Just as he was stabbing me I woke up, sweating lightly and my legs shaking even though I wasn't standing.\r  \n\r  \nThis happened just today... What does this mean? Did I get suggested by something?"

My boyfriend is there with me and we are trying to find privacy to have sex. We find a room that is like a shed, there is steam\nComing from a nearby hose in the wall and gravel on the ground. We begin kissing and the gravel or broken glass gets in my mouth. I try to pick it out - I want to give my boyfriend head but the gravel or broken glass is in my mouth. It occurs to me that the air or the entire site is probably toxic - due to its nature of being an old industrial site. \n\nNext scene - it is bedtime and my boyfriend is putting my son to bed (common in my waking life).\nMy son won‚Äôt sleep, I open a floor level window while holding him. Outside the window, there is a row of evening spaces faves with a small flower in each. Someone is parked in front of the window with two small children sitting on the side walk. I reach to open the window and it knocks the small vase and the water spills on the sidewalk wetting the children. They begin to cry. I call for someone to bring towels and for help. My son slowly slips from my arms through the open window and bumps the back of his head - it‚Äôs a very small fall maybe 3 inches. \n\nI am concerned, and carry him back to the bed - he seems asleep but I am worried about a brain bleed from the bump. My mom and aunt are there - I consult with them. They say he is fine but I can see his eyes flickering as if he is about to convulse. His face begins changing and I know he is not well. He transforms into an aggressive version of himself - like\nChucky. he keep trying to attack me. I block his attacks with nearby objects - which he smashes with his fists. When he charges at me I pick him up from his arm and set him down on furniture. This happens several\nTime. Someone nearby lifts a large piece of wood or a wooden toy to hit him and I yell for the person to stop - ‚Äúdon‚Äôt hurt him.‚Äù I call out to those around me - ‚Äúcall 911, please google to see if a bump on the head causes aggressiveness.‚Äù I decide to try and corral him by playing a game and telling Conor he is a monster I need to catch. It seems to focus his energy on me - it feels dark and evil. I finally grab him and he becomes an empty box in my hands - like a flattened happy meal box. I wake up screaming, ‚ÄúI have the monster.‚Äù\n\nObservation - writing this  dream down causes me sob \nFeelings upon waking - terror, grief,\nConfusion and helplessness because no one would help me in my dream\n\nEvents leading up - three days before fought with my BFF bc she has been gossiping about me and I felt unwelcome at her house during a visit. Night before dream - boyfriend upset with me over what I perceive to be a minor issue."

Which number brings luck when playing lottery - lottery?** \n\nYou also know, with thousands of different dreams, with the dream of being pregnant being considered the most common. To better understand this dream, let Mu88 give a detailed answer in the specific article below.\r  \n\r  \n**How to interpret dreams of being pregnant?**\r  \nDreaming of pregnancy is a fairly common phenomenon and can be caused by many different reasons. Here are some common interpretations for this paranormal dream:\r  \n\r  \n**Delusions:** A common cause of pregnancy dreams is delusions. In dreams, we can imagine situations, landscapes, and events without reality. Therefore, the dream of being pregnant may just be an illusion that we create in our imagination.\r  \n\r  \n**Influence from reality:** Another possible cause is the influence of reality. If in our daily life we ‚Äã‚Äãare thinking or worrying about getting pregnant or preparing to get pregnant, then the pregnancy dream could be just a reflection of those thoughts.\r  \n\r  \n**Emotions:** Pregnancy dreams can also be a reflection of different emotions we are experiencing, like happiness, anxiety, or stress. Sometimes dreams can also indicate our desires, hopes or fears.\r  \n\r  \n\rIn summary, dreaming of pregnancy can be due to many different causes and there is not a single explanation for all cases. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon in the dream and has no effect on reality.\r  \n\r  \n**What does it mean to dream about being pregnant?**  \nThere is no one specific and common meaning for all pregnancy dreams. Each dream has its own message and meaning, which depends on many factors such as emotional state, the situation in the dream, memories and personal experiences of each person. Here are some meanings of dreams about good and bad things in your life:  \n**Dreaming about being pregnant**  \nDreaming of being pregnant is a very happy and joyful thing for women who are expecting children. However, this creates confusion for women planning without children or husbands. The dream that you are pregnant is usually a good omen, a happy and extremely lucky thing for women who are expecting children. In the coming days, your family life will be favorable and peaceful, because life is often full of luck and happiness.  \n**Dreaming that someone else is pregnant**  \nTo dream that an acquaintance is pregnant is the message that this dream wants to send to you that is to always be happy and live sincerely. Your relationship with your pregnant dream girlfriend is still very good, close, and close. Please try to save it.  \nSee more: [https://mu88.watch/mo-co-bau/](https://mu88.watch/mo-co-bau/)"

    "body": "The first part of my dream I remember getting into this elevator with two other girls. As the door closed, we began to fall very fast. At first we thought the whole elevator was falling and we‚Äôd soon hit the bottom. We then realized that the top of of the elevator wasn‚Äôt moving at all. The bottom of the elevator had been a false bottom and we manage to grip on either side of the ‚Äúelevator walls‚Äù. We first tried climbing up but decided it‚Äôd be easier to climb down as long as we did not fall. It seemed to have gone on forever but when we reached the bottom, there was some sort of ramp. This was sort of mind boggling, because surely that fall would‚Äôve killed us and we would‚Äôve slid out at the bottom. We slowly slid out and found ourselves in some sort of factory. There were conveyor belts with packing boxes -just regular old cardboard boxes. \n\nI don‚Äôt remember much more, but the next part of the dream, we were stationed outside moving these large tubs - not the same as the packing boxes from before. There was a large building with two white folding tables and several large trucks surrounding the area. However there were a lot more women here and they are all quite young. There was an elder women yelling and ordering us to put the boxes under and on these tables, and to make sure they are sealed tightly before doing so. There was one with the top sitting on it with one corner of it being uncovered. A girl close by tripped into it and much faster than me and the other girls, she managed to grab onto the sides. I reached in to help pull her out. The lady began to yell and ask who left the box unsealed. A girl sepped forward to explain it was already unsealed and she was unsure of what to do. As the woman began to drag this girl away, I realized that this is very similar to what happened with the elevator, and I assumed all of these tubs contain endless holes, but don‚Äôt understand how. \n\nThe next part of the dream is a strange series of images and happenstances‚Ä¶ The one that sticks out to me the most is the image of a never ending staircase. I believe I have seen this illusion somewhere before, where someone seems to be running up a staircase that always leads back to the same place. But when the perspective is changed, the illusion breaks. I‚Äôve seen it in dreams before, and when I realize it the illusion breaks. Ive seen it in many different ways, but it seems like I see it all at once. One way is that u see the separation of the stairs, from beginning to end, sort of like a 3d model. Another way is as if I‚Äôm looking over the staircase into an abyss. The last way I watch as the person running on the stairs fall to their death‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt quite put these visuals into a specific place in my dream. They either occur before during or after the part I‚Äôm about to explain.\nThe next part of the dream, I am shackled to all the other women and we are walking up these stairs -not the same stairs I see in the visuals- I look up and see tattered wall paper and old portraits on the walls. The stairs have patterned carpet, and some of the flowers on the carpet have a shimmer to them. There are multiple staircases covered in these women, and the ceiling seems to be miles away. There are large men with face coverings guiding the women and belittling them.\n\nAt some point I have escaped these shackles and I‚Äôm running through these halls like I‚Äôm on a mission. I can see other people searching for me as I cause chaos throughout this mansion. I‚Äôm not sure what all I was doing to anger the people ‚Äúin charge‚Äù but the older woman is ordering the men previously mentioned to find me and sedate me. I realized that I can peel the wall back and sort of phase through to different rooms. When I do this it‚Äôs sort of wrapping myself into the wall like a blanket. This goes on forever and I can‚Äôt really explain all of the events that take place, but basically I‚Äôm traveling through the walls and I‚Äôm somewhat omniscient at this point. While running through a hallway, I run into a young man, he is much smaller than me he men previously mentioned. I realize I can take him with me when I go into the walls. As we phase in and out of the walls he gives me more information about what‚Äôs going on. We search the mansion to find more people who can be saved. However, I phase through a wall, and he does not come through with me. \n\nNow I gotta explain a reoccurring thing in my dreams to explain the last portion of this dream. This always occurs in different dreams, they never start the same. Something that is always the same though, is I‚Äôll walk into a room, and when I exit the room I‚Äôve entered what seems to be a completely different realm. I sort of glide across the floor here, and even float higher at times. This place is like a dark mysterious building but I can‚Äôt fully explain what it looks like. I can vividly see it in my mind, but it‚Äôs really weird. It‚Äôs sort of a collection of corridors, almost like a maze. The first time I had this happen I could hear a lot of voices telling me where to go and what to do, but the voices were conflicting with one another in what they were saying. The first time it took forever, but I end up at this ‚Äúwall‚Äù. This wall is a collection of colors and red beams. The colors are more like static, and the red beams bounce both back and forth and up and down. It is a very large wall, and I can‚Äôt decided if it‚Äôs safe to go through. I eventually decide there is nowhere else to go. I float upwards and through the wall, and once again everything has shifted. I‚Äôm sort of out of control in which way my body floats, and there are images and colors flying all around me. I‚Äôve had this happen in many dreams, but they seem to get closer and closer. The first reoccurrence was months after the first occurrence, and now I‚Äôve had it happen back to back. The first time it happened it took me forever to find this ‚Äúwall‚Äù and each time it seems to get easier and easier, like I just know where to go. In the dream I explained above, I immediately arrived at this ‚Äúwall‚Äù and went straight in. All the chaos started like normal, but I felt a sense of peace and maybe even control over this space."

I‚Äôve always had very vivid and almost psychic dreams, enough to where I used to keep a dream journal from all of the memories and stories I‚Äôd come up with- more than three in just one night. And the bear symbolism- could possibly be from the the Alaska hiking and camping videos that I watch at nighttime. But the context is different than the wholesome videos I watch. \n\nIn the first dream, I was being chased by two black bears around a playground. And then the next dream was me walking home from a convenience store and finding a black bear blocking my path home. They‚Äôve never attacked me (I‚Äôve always forced myself to wake up before they could) but their presence has been enough to intimidate me into attempting to run away or escape in some way. In my dreams, I‚Äôm never saved or rescued by anyone and so I wake up suddenly and in a panic."

    "body": "So there was this lady; she was older and kind of looked like the lady from American horror story but she had all these torture devices and knives. We were in a house that kind of looked like my grandmas house in the front but the back was different. So like she was torturing me and another girl by slicing my fingers and like putting them in this weird device that peeled the skin back. Then she was having us do this to other people or we would get tortured more. There was a group of friends that lived across the street. We went over there to ‚Äúmake friends ‚Äú so we could set them up to bring them back to her. They were not very nice people and they were making fun of me and the other girl. Idk who she was. One of the girls was pretty mean so we chose her as the like sacrifice. Then there was an alligator that was walking around when we got back to my grandmas house. For a minute there was a counter like a restaurant there where the girl came. The alligator was trying to get her and came in the house. It tried to bite me too even though I wasn‚Äôt the target. I went to the back of the house to hide from it and locked the door. I found a notebook with letters from people who were tortured and killed under a pillow on the bed. I read them and then the lady who was torturing had a husband that came. He turned her into the police and I was skeptical because why did he wait so long. Was he part of it the whole time? Then I woke up. \n\n\nI have had dreams like this since I was a little girl for example, when I was young I still remember this dream where I went into my parents room and saw two demons jumping on their bed and (I used to be religious at this time) I was like in the name of jesus blah blah and they laughed at me and said you really think that will work üíÄ \n\nLet me know what you guys think could be the interpretation of the dream from last night because idk"

I think the pretty vintage ones were really cheap and so I remember grabbing one and holding it close. It was overall very dark and a little creepy inside. And then I‚Äôm not sure why but I had a little brother waddling along too like maybe 4 years old (to clarify I only have an older brother who is an adult male) and I think someone who was supposed to be my mum. As we were about to exit the house I see little brother waddle behind an armchair and I lose sight of him, and then this weird wolf/beast looking thing walks towards me and says he‚Äôs gone now and that he‚Äôll replace him, if you say anything neither of you can leave and then the animal got all deformed and morphed into the exact body of my little brother and we walked out of the house‚Ä¶ does this have any significance?"

The chairs were in a circular row and I was on the left side. There was a big projector. It was nighttime. The teacher was saying something and I remember giggling with a girl next to me about something. The teacher told me to please be quiet and said something else rude. I remember myself whispering to the girl next to me saying \"This bitch crazy.\" The teacher got furious and started yelling. I denied I said that to her. Then she threated to kill me and sexual assault me. I ran out the classroom and throughtout the whole dream, I was running from the teacher throughout the entire school. The school was huge, and in some instances I could see her chasing me, but then I'd disappear. Then, All I remeber is spending time in another room in the school with a bunch of students. I think I was having fun and was at peace. One of the studentss encouraged me to go back to classroom and apologize. She said her and a friend would come with me. I reluctantly went back to the classroom and said sorry, and the teacher accepted my apology and still lectured me on not to do it again,\r  \n\r  \n\r  \n\r  \nI never really had a strict teacher before and I never was scolded for doing something like that.

    "body": "Let's start by saying I'm not a strong believer that dreams have always meaningful messages behind them so I'm not scared about what I'm going to share here, it's just interesting and kinda curious.\n\nWhen I was little I used to have this nightmare all the time. I used to sleep in the \"big bed\" with her until I was I guess like 5 or 6 years old. The nightmare was always like this: in my sleep, I woke up for something, I don't know I needed to drink or go to the bathroom, and I looked beside me to see my mother sleeping on her side giving me her back. So I got out of bed, did my things and went to the kitchen, where I would find my mother doing something like cooking and be like \"Oh you woke up\", leaving me with the question of who actually was sleeping beside me in the bed.\n\nI remember doing this dream all the time and be engulfed in a sense of complete dread and despair.\n\nNow I'm 30 years old and I'm having another recurring nightmare regarding my mother for the last couple of weeks. I find this peculiar because it's the second instance in my entire life in which I explicitly remember having the same nightmare more than once, and also so close to the first time, and this one is also about my mother (which, for context, is still alive and totally fine).\n\nI dream that we have a terrible fight, like screaming and berating one another in terrible ways, and then she dies. Not only she dies, she has an actual ictus right between my arms, like it's activated by her rage or her screaming. The dream is extremely brutal and graphic: I don't know how an ictus actually works, but her face basically melts in front of me, like half of it, while she screams something along the line \"Oh God I'm dying, I'm dying\". \n\nIt kinda impressed me. My mother's fine and while we don't agree all the time we're in a totally normal mother-son relationship and absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in the last few weeks or months. I'm also surprised that the only two recurring nightmare I've had in my life are 100% about her, but I guess that's pretty normal too I mean it's my mother."

Even when all heck breaks lose (I wake up the planet sized serpent in the deep water and the world is destroyed) they are still beautiful dreams.

Moreover, the dream foretells wealth, fame and happiness that is knocking on your door. Dreaming of fish predicts that you will inherit a huge fortune from your family. It is expected that with this money you do not have to do anything, you can live comfortably until the end of your life. However, the dream interpretation advises you to try to build your career because gambling will have a mountain of gold.\r  \n\r  \nThe meaning lies in the dream of seeing carp\r  \nTo dream of a fish is a good omen, fortune and prosperity will come to you in the near future. However, if you dream that a golden carp is eaten by a crocodile, it is a harbinger of trouble. It is best during this period to limit going out and be wary of strangers. When someone you're not familiar with taking leave will help you, and you can best solve the problem on your own by refusing to accept that help.\n\n\r\r  \nDreaming of dead fish  \nIt is a bad omen, a sign of the end of a relationship, things that should not be kept should be given up. Not only that, but this dream also helps you to put your past behind and move towards a better future. Meanwhile, if you see a bunch of processed fish and have a bad smell, this will indicate that you need to go through a difficult and hard time for yourself.  \nDreaming of a mermaid  \nThis is a good omen of love, you will meet your soul mate, the two are very compatible so a marriage will take place in the near future. In some cases, if the mermaid comes close to you and sings, it is a sign that your work is extremely favorable and business is thriving.  \nDreaming that I was eating fish  \nThis foretells you will be favorable, your career development opportunities are great. Continue to be confident in your ability, seize the opportunity well, you will surely succeed in the not too distant future. Not only that, this dream is also a symbol of your spirituality, health and life. Specifically, if you dreamed of carp eating meat, congratulations, good luck has come to you.  \n**&gt;&gt;&gt;See more:** [**https://mu88.watch/mo-thay-ca/**](https://mu88.watch/mo-thay-ca/)"

    "body": "*scene*\n\nI pull up to a parking lot at a park, having just spent the day, apparently my day off, playing basketball, skateboarding, and generally filling my day with things I enjoy. It's about 4:30 - 5:00 pm outside, and I proceeded to get out of my car and go for a walk in the park while sparking a joint.\n\nAs I get out, there is a mid 30's, brown haired, somewhat chubby, hippy dressed, red satchel wearing gentleman in a second, dirt parking lot in front of me, playing his guitar, singing, and dancing with some pretty decent talent. I spark my joint and watch, standing there, transfixed by his happiness. As I puff on my joint and head out for my walk, he approaches me.\n\n\"Awesome bro!\" I tell him, with a miniature applause. \"I really enjoyed your performance!\" I still have about a third of the joint left, so I hand it to him with the classic stoner 'Ere!, and ask him about himself.\n\nImmediately, it becomes apparent that he wasn't really all there. His singing did not transfer to being able to formulate real speech, and he definitely seemed nonverbal. I try to talk to him a while, telling him about my day, that I also play guitar and sing, and some other things, but eventually I give up and go on my walk. The walk is a fast forward in dream time, but I remember watching the sun start to descend.\n\nWhen I get back to the parking lot, I see him on the sidewalk of the dirt lot, rocking and fiddling and stimming in a mad, autistic sort of way. Realizing he is homeless, I want to help him. When I approach and ask him his name, and if I could get him some food or anything, he is just completely unaware of the world around him. I try for a bit to get his attention, but when I notice he still has the joint as I had handed it to him, unsmoked and intact, I give up and back away.\n\nAs I start my car, I notice his red satchel in the parking spot next to me, underneath the tire of another vehicle. I get out, pick it up and dust it off. Heading over to return it to him, I am already getting emotional at the sad sight of this man.\n\n\"Hey buddy,\" I say as I approach. \"You dropped your bag!\" I squat in front of him and try to hand it back, but he still doesn't notice me. Try as I might to break him of his trance, he just isn't in this world at the time. \"I'm just going to set it down here next to you, okay? Don't forget it again! I'm sure it's important.\"\n\nAt this point night has fallen, and the moon is bright. I start to turn away before standing up, and as soon as my eyes are off of him I am startled to feel his hand snatch my wrist. I turn back in shock, and he is looking at me with a piercing gaze, tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Thank you.\" He says.\n\nI immediately start to cry. Sobbing, I reach into my pocket saying, \"Can I please show you something?\" He nods, and as I pull out my phone to show him a picture of my real life 6 week old baby daughter, as I look at the phones screen...\n\n*scene*\n\nI wake up. With actual tears in my eyes, and still in the swings of a 1¬∞-1.5¬∞ fever.\n\nUpon waking, I definitely felt frustrated that I woke up before showing him the picture. It felt really important for some reason. I've been crying on and off since this dream, I honestly don't remember the last time I was this emotional for this long, if ever.\n\nI have an instinctual interpretation of this, but I want to hear what other people say without influencing your interpretation.\n\nThanks for reading."

I went outside later in the dream and found a kid with sweatpants and a sweatshirt picking up a rifle, then I ran back home and called the police. Later I was walking around and saw seniors who had just graduated, implying this was the senior graduation day. ( which is next month)The dream went some other ways after that, like my mom took me to a gas station it got boring after that but I woke up and texted my cousin in a group chat with him and my friends about the dream. My friend who goes to the same school as me, who I was also thinking about during the dream, texted and she also had a school shooting dream. The description of the kid and event and everything was very similar. What could this mean??"

It was vivid to where I remember this red/bloody moon that was getting bigger and a sense of fear, I also remembered that I could feel the world was about to end, the worst sense of doom. Then I can‚Äôt remember exactly but some kind of explosion or maybe the sun hit the earth. I just remember the feelings were so real and terrible but the only talking/interaction was the very end where I had this intense feeling that I just had to get the words ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù out of my mouth right before it was over/the world ends. I was needing to tell my kids, they are 3 and almost 5. I just cant shake the intense feeling at the end and it almost ended with relief, SO bizarre. \n\nI will add that my mom and sister and I are very open about our dreams since I was young. I have had dreams about family members passing before someone actually passes. I know it sounds crazy, but I am completely being  honest. My mom actually takes all of my vivid dreams serious. I am the youngest of 5, I have 3 brothers and a sister.\n\nThe last time I had a very emotional feeling dream was about my brother. I had dreamt that I was in this courtyard with pillars everywhere, kids waking around too. I was trying to get to my bother, I knew something was wrong but I didn‚Äôt know what. The emotion and feelings of dread and fear were so intense I woke up and started crying which I‚Äôve never done. I was just following him trying to get to him but he was just always right out of reach. Nothing bad happened in my dream but the bad feeling only intensified. I‚Äôll never forget this feeling, it felt like my soul was being ripped out of me.\n\nA week after this dream, my brother (same from my dream) almost died from a bowel perforation and the radiologist missed it TWICE. I‚Äôm a nurse, but I saw him in the hospital for the two days and the exact feelings from the dream I had in real life. I was actually physically feeling sick and so scared that this was actually happening. I had to tell the nurse that he was not ok and eventually was able to get a doctor in the room on the 3rd day. They called a rapid response immediately when the doc saw how terrible he looked; dusky. Within 2 hours he was in emergency surgery. I literally saved him, he was so close to the end it was unreal. They never figured out why or what caused this random perforation and he has no history. \n\nI have not been the same since this happened last March. I actually finally went for Cognitive processing therapy and realized I had ptsd from it all and thankfully doing much better.\nI just wanted to give a background on my dream history because I have had a hard time processing my dreams after it happening to my brother.\n\nFor once, nothing stressful or crazy is happening in my life. I have autoimmune disease that has been affecting my muscles and heart rate more, I wondered if it‚Äôs maybe anxiety that something is going to happen to me?"

The room wasn't completely dark, it was partially lit by one of those old low quality yellow basement lights. In this room were three distinct things, a concrete beam in the middle of it, the lower half of a plastic bottle to catch water droplets that were dripping from the ceiling that was pretty low and one of those old wooden chairs facing the beam. For some reason I can't explain, I felt this otherwordly sense of dread and terror, I was almost having a panic attack, I felt my heart racing, was developing tunnel vision, my throat drying up and my eyes popping out of my head just looking at this room. The rest of the dream i do not remember, just this part. I've been thinking about this dream the whole day and I still do not understand why I felt this primal level of terror just looking at this room, I don't know why but I'm positive that it was supernatural."

She placed her hands on my shoulders and said, \"I want you kill my son and do it quickly.\" I was caught so off guard and so scared because when I looked at her face she was so dead serious about it. \n\nHer son is like 4 years old.\n\n\"Lure him to those woods over there and strangle him or maybe hit his head with a rock. Be sure to check if he has stopped breathing. Do you hear me?\" I immediately pushed her away and gave her a disgusted look as I backed away from her. I went over to where her son was laying and I picked him up. I looked at his mother again menacing as I make my way to the street to try and catch a cab. But luckily and police car was driving by and I waved at them to stop. Both cops came out from their car and I told them everything. After they've heard the whole story they went straight to the park and arrested my aunt and then I woke up."

The longer i stayed in care the more we loved eachother but i also remembered my marriage to my real life husband and it started to conflict me. I couldn't remember my husbands name or face. I just knew i was left in the hospitol with the doctor and not even a phone call from my husband to see if i'm ok. Last thing i remember before waking up was contacting him to tell him i'm moving on to be with the doctor. I'm genuinely shaken from this but still feeling so loved from the dream affair.

If you are amongst those who have been injured, we are on our way to help.‚Äù I got disappointed and went to go exit the hospital, but somehow ended up inside the haunted house. It was dark and there were holes EVERYWHERE In the wooden floor where people had fallen through. I was trying to use my phone flashlight to go around them but there were so many and they were huge.

    "body": "I guess this title has been used a thousand times on this subreddit, but I really didn't know what else to introduce my post with.\n\nAnyways, let's dive in it. I don't remember the exact chronology of my dream but parts of it, which I will try to restitute :\n ‚Ä¢I remember being inside a sort of narrow towel entirely made up of stairs. I was surrounded by a thick crowd of persons, and most of them climbed up, but for some reason, I decided to follow two women who were climbing down. I extirpated myself of the ascending group and walked behind the two women. They were tidyly dressed, and I had a sudden spike of feeling powerful and special walking in the steps of these two non-conforming and supposedly clever and upper-classed ladies. I instantly visualized in my mind's eye myself wearing the same clothes as theirs and imitating their assertive attitude, which made me feel superior. But as we were progressing down, the stairs got completely tangled. But when I say tangled, I really mean it. Some parts of it even were more scale-looking, it was a mess. One woman disappeared, and the other tried not to fall. Her look turned less classy, and I could finally see her face. She had an exagerated expression of fear, and seemed way more ordinary than I had thought earlier. Concerning me, I was afraid of losing control and falling, everything around me was flimsy and cracked.\n ‚Ä¢Later in the dream, I was back home. I saw my cat and advanced towards her, but I felt something different about her. When I approached her, I coud remove her skin and fur. My real cat smelt her, shocked, and I didn't know how to react. I was numb.\n\nWhat could it mean ??"

    "body": "**Some background:** He was a poor communicator unless we were in person and would constantly let me down, \"forget\" or go back on promises made. It was clear he didn't care or couldn't be bothered with me if i got too much for him i guess. I'd just be ignored until i waited long enough for him to reply or i essentially,  blew up his phone. which was usually what happened. I'd vent my frustrations, try to distance, ghost him even but he would act hurt by those actions and want me to \"come back\" to the friendship but never compromised on what i asked of him. Once he moved away, he didn't care about maintaining the friendship. It was rough but i eventually and finally removed him and stuck to it. With that out of the way let's get to the dreams...\n\nI've had about 3 vivid dreams about him. To preface, I don't remember my dreams. Ever. (Aka i dont dream) but whenever i wake up from a full rest and go back to sleep to catch some extra Zzz's, thats when i get the weirdest dreams like being young again with all my elementary class mates going through this maze like house while everyone is roasting/bullying me or trying to fight someone but my arms are like wet noodles no matter how hard i swing. I try to run away but im slower than a snail despite going full speed.\n\nWith him, the dreams were EXTREMELY WHOLESOME (he, irl is an antisocial loner who ill look you dead in the eye and walk away mid conversation if he doesn't know you and doesn't want to talk). The first one was last year so the memory has faded but the second one happened  a little over a month ago. I was in Laos and strangely i was there with the side of my family i dont like. It was a good time. Everyone was having fun on the beach, by the water etc. I went in to some sort of beach restaurant and i saw him from the corner of my eye but wasn't sure if he saw me, I avoided him and went back to my family. I see him walk by while im with them but this time we make eye contact. I don't acknowledge i just kind of act like i looked past him. I go back to the place where i first saw him (i think for food, idk its a dream lol) and he sees me again, eye contact again, but this time i smile but still look away. Next thing i know he's approaching me and he is in full uniform (Air force vet but was wearing a Marine uniform in my dream. Idk why) in front of me catching up with me and we end up just talking and walking along the beach and i eventually go my separate ways back to my family and then i wake up.\n\nThe reason i think im in Laos or even Vietnam at this time is because before i stopped talking to him, he was vacationing in one of these places which I also plan to go to for my own trip when im older. But I don't understand why i was having a good time with people I personally cutted out of my life.\n\nThe second dream i had today. Same situation of falling asleep again. I was with friends in this dream and we were having a good time (outside settingni believe. We were on a bench) then he appears and again, same old catching up but he's completely changed in physical appearance this time. He had outrageous ink and piercings and facial implants, grew his hair out longer than before had a whole different style too. It surprisingly didn't turn me away, i still found him easy on the eyes in the face. In this dream he was a lot more openly affectionate: hugs, sitting close, forehead kisses and just seeming like he changed but it was a maaaajor 180. All of these gestures I did not reciprocate or acknowledge. I just smiled and continue whatever i was doing.\n\nI guess what i want to know is, why am I having better-than-reality dreams about someone who I have long since cut off and want nothing to do with anymore? I genuinely dont miss him. He made me feel shitty about myself without even trying. And I went quite a long time (little over 3 months) without a thought or care or regard in the world about him. He is absolutely a chapter close. And yet my dreams make me feel like there's such a high possibility of us running in to each other again (there's not, i promise) if we do i will not act like everything is fine like i did last time. I will call him out and want answers if i ever have the displeasure of meeting him again. \n\nSo why the wholesome shit brain???"

Last night I had another nightmare about her banging on the front door of the house we grew up in and her yelling at my younger sister.

I honestly was a little bummed that I woke up. I carried that cat through this town for a while.\n\nI stopped at a gas station, apparently my landlord owned it. I told the man that I was going to drop off my rent check but actually had forgotten it. He was okay with it, but was *very* nervous about my new friend, haha. \n\nAny idea what this deep royal blue colored cat means? She was as sweet as pie....she made me feel so comforted and loved. The vibrations of her purrs made me feel so at peace. This dream is definitely a nice change from the parade of nightmares I've had for the last few weeks. Any help would mean the world to me, thank you! üíú"

    "body": "About a month ago, I had a very strange and memorable dream about someone I‚Äôve only ever seen a few times in an old photograph, about 110 years old. The person in question, for whatever reason, did have a vague sort of familiarity to them, but I have not been able to place my finger on a relation to any person I‚Äôve met in my waking life. A few weeks after seeing the photo, I had pretty much not thought about it much at all, until I went to sleep on a Friday night, and had this dream. In the dream, I appeared on a dirt path running from left to right, with an old house directly in front of me. Everything in the dream was in black and white. The girl from the photo was standing in the doorway, and behind her, inside the house, was pure pitch blackness. When we saw each other, there was a moment of extreme elation between both of us, and we met each other on the porch of this house and hugged, both very happy to see each other. Like two old friends meeting after many years. The dream then skipped to what I thought was the inside of this house, sitting on an old style couch. We were sitting side by side, looking rigidly straight ahead. We never turned to look at each other, but I could see her also looking straight ahead in my peripheral vision. Ahead of me, I could see only a sparse wooden plank floor stretching on for about 15 feet, and then it faded to just darkness. I could not see the end of the room. For whatever reason, I became aware that we were unable to speak to each other, but we could sort of feel each others emotions, and we were surrounded by the most warm happy feeling, like just so happy to even exist next to each other. And then, she simply leaned over, and pushed her left cheek against my right cheek, and it was extremely surprising to me in the dream. I could feel every detail of her face. It was the most real and detailed physical sensation I‚Äôve ever had in a dream. She then simply pulled away without a word, and we continued to stare straight on into this darkness. The dream then skipped to us in a standing position, her directly in front of me with her back to me, and me with my hands on both of her shoulders from behind, still just looking straight ahead. I made note of how small and fragile her frame felt, too small for her, and it concerned me for a moment. She was shorter than me, coming up to about the bottom of my chin, and I could just make out the top and back of her head as we both looked forward. It then felt like she took me to a doorway, still in the same position as before, except now we were looking into a small ornate mirror on the wall inside this room. And we just stood there, staring at ourselves in this mirror, still surrounded by that same incredible warm feeling from before. She wore the slightest smirk on her face as we looked into the mirror, and I noted to myself that she was really pretty. And then it was over."

    "body": "Monday, May 22\n\nLast night I had a dream about me, a girl, and time travel\n\nSo it started off with me and my friends at a convention for our school or something. I'm guessing it was for jobs after high-school. Anyway, I was hanging out and I started talking to this girl named Maddison Duley. She was a popular girl at my school. After a little bit of talking, we snuck off to the shipping bay of the building we were in.(the building was kinda like a supermarket) After talking about us and what we like and just getting to know each other better, I leaned in to kiss her and it she was laying on the floor I was over top of her with my eyes facing her chin. She said \"No, we are not kissing upside down, come over here and kiss me normally\". We did and when I opened my eyes, I was back in my chair from a couple hours earlier. After the convention finished, I realized that I had the ability to time travel and I don't know how I got it. I went to my best friend Jesse and I said the following (his mom was taking us home) \"Jesse, so I have the ability to time travel, don't ask how, I don't know. Anyways, I was talking to a girl and I kissed her. I had her, you know? I got a girlfriend! But then I accidentally timetravelled mid kiss and now I'm worried I won't ever get her back!\" \"What do I do?\" Jesse said \"idk man, if you really want this girl then no offense to my mom but screw her and go get her\" to this I said \"thanks bro, I love you\" and ran off to go get her.\n\nI made it in the building and then got arrested by the in building police because of disorderly conduct because apparently I was making a ruckus by running around the building looking for Maddison. As I was sitting in this tiny silverish black cell, I saw two guards outside at a long control panel facing away from the cell sitting down. Outside the cell, there was another inmate named Hunter Bryd sitting at the control panel with the guards. Our outfits were teal btw. Anyways, I had enough and time traveled to get out of this but little did I know I traveled back to a few minutes before I kissed Maddison and this time travel sent me to the timeline where I kissed and disappeared from her. I unknowingly went looking for her and couldn't find her. I decided to go back to my cell and serve my short time there (about 2 hours). I saw that they didn't even know I was gone because the two guards and hunter were watching a movie on a projector. I served my last 10 minutes and walked out. I tore off the prison stuff and it had my normal cloths underneath. As I walked down this white hallway, I saw a senior I knew, Ella. She knew Maddison. I ran to her and asked her if she has seen Maddison. She said to come with her because she was the head of security cameras. As I walked into her room, Maddison came down the hallway crying. At that moment, I realized that I was back in my original timeline. I ran to Maddison and asked her what's wrong. She kept crying. I asked her if she wanted to go to a place more private to talk and she said yes. We walked to Ella's room because I knew Ella didn't mind. When we got in there, we laid on the bed and I tried to talk to her. She pushed me over on my back and tried to straddle me. She asked what I wanted and I said \"I want you to be my girlfriend.\" She seemed upset and confused by this. I assume it was because I didn't explain my sudden disappearance. She ran out crying and I chased after her. \n\nThat is all I remember from this dream."

This wasn't abnormal as she always slept with us since she was a baby. \nI stopped in the doorway because floating above her was a giant eye. It was like it was scanning her or studying her. It wasn't harming her and I didn't feel scared at all. It floated above her looking at her, then looked over at me briefly, I was still standing in the doorway, and then went back to looking at her. Then I noticed my daughter's eyes were rolled back in her head, but again, I didn't feel anxiety like in a nightmare. It was very vivid and I woke up questioning if it had actually happened. \nSomeone interpreted this dream for me when I had it 10+ years ago, but I cant find the interpretation and wondered if I would get the same interpretation a second time too. \nDoes anyone know the meaning behind this dream? for my daughter and/or me?"

    "body": "I was in my high-school age hometown, on my way to school (I think at this stage I was driving). As I was crossing a major junction, there was a pop-up flower shop with a 50% sale. I stop to grab a single orange delphinium and continue on my way to school (now walking). \n\nMajor train tracks run through my hometown. As I was walking, ahead there was a stationary train about to depart. It was cargo toward the rear, two vagrants were train hopping. The train starts to leave, one gets on, the second throws his bag up but quickly the space to jump is too great and he misses it. \n\nSuddenly, I‚Äôm now on the train. In a passenger carriage. The dirty vagrants are next to me, the one who missed saunters in and sits down with his friends. We are moving quickly. We aren‚Äôt going to school, it doesn‚Äôt stop there like I thought it did. That‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll get off at the next stop. The next stop is somewhere unfamiliar to me. It‚Äôs high in mountains. We‚Äôve travelled through tunnels to get there. We pull into the station. It‚Äôs a dead-end, the last stop. I leave the train-station quickly because I feel anxious, I want to walk back to my hometown. \n\nI have to walk down the mountain. It‚Äôs a rocky ravine, it‚Äôs dangerous - like a goat-track and I‚Äôm scared. I have a sandwich with me and I don‚Äôt want to drop it over the side. There‚Äôs all sorts of hazards including slippery plastic on the track. Two 30-40yo women are coming up. They have sneakers on. I don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre better prepared than I am. They tell me that I‚Äôm going the wrong way. If I carry on, it‚Äôs a 3 hour journey to the next town (which is in the wrong direction I want to travel in). \n\nI look around to try and see landmarks. I‚Äôm confused because the landmarks keep changing. Now the ladies have told me where I am, I can orient myself. I‚Äôll have to go back up to the train-station to return to town after all, it‚Äôs the safest option. \n\nSo I‚Äôm climbing back up. All of a sudden there‚Äôs all these grandmas climbing toward the train station. I ask if they can hold my sandwich in their handbag so that I can climb up too. I‚Äôve removed the plastic from the ledge so that everyone can walk smoothly and won‚Äôt slip. The old lady directly behind me grudgingly puts my sandwich in her bag, but she wants to get past me. We take a couple steps before she hands my sandwich back and tells me that I better look after it if I want to get back. \n\nShe pulls out a map (it looks like the marauders map from Harry Potter, it‚Äôs a magic map) and it starts self-drawing to reveal the route the train took through the tunnels and mountains. It‚Äôs not at all the route I thought I was going. Now I‚Äôm going up to the train to catch it back to my hometown to start over. \n\nNote: I lived in two towns, one aged 0-14 and a second 14-18. This setting is the latter. I now (31) live overseas &amp; have for a decade. I was my current-age in this dream."

It was a little dingy in there, and it was very, very shot back; it was a massive room, full of all the same furniture (it all went together very well) and the family was mostly men.

She said ‚ÄúI want to go to the Galleria.‚Äù my response to that was, ‚ÄúHow on earth, do you expect us to go to the galleria in a horse-drawn carriage? It‚Äôll take forever!‚Äù Still I thought maybe I can appease her by taking a little short drive. So she told me to just use the white one. It‚Äôs a single person one and it‚Äôs just four of us (two being her small children), so I abide her request and go and try to retrieve the carriage; It was in a little barn above a pond, and once I went to go get it, it was just a re-purposed washer with wheels. üôÑ"

I think I also tried to have someone else make it for me but they didn't make it right so I made it myseld. I chose batman and some blonde character I can't remember the name of. Put the blonde character in the flower as if she were trapped and reenacted a senario where batman was saving her. All of the projects were stupid but no one clapped for mine rip. \n\n- Was in a gemini home entertainment type world (apocalyptic fiction on yt) where I had to drive a car at night. Drove with my sister to make her scared because for some reason I though it was a virtual game at first. Animals with bright lights for eyes at the side of the road very creepy. Had to stop to get fuel but another car was coming, tried to do it quickly with my sister (got mad at her) and managed to but only just as the car got there. I think I tried going around the car at first but then got out of mine and I ran off and started lying down in some snow.

I don‚Äôt recall recall clouds or even stars, mostly the sun and moon change of placement.\n\nWhen it stopped, it seemed to be sunset time, the sun in an unfamiliar location casting unfamiliar shadows, and illuminating areas on a mountain range that I had never seen before. It was un familiar and uncomfortable, and that seems to be a significant feeling in this dream. \n\nOnly my mother and I noticed it. No one else in the area did. But they knew something was up because they started preparing for either leaving or dying.\n\nIn my dreams, I know fully well how significant and vast the sky is.

I had a dream maybe a month ago, I was at my dad's house and there was a ghost in the bathroom. I had holy water and just kept it with me. Eventually I got along with it and became friends. It turns out it was not a ghost but a demon. After a while he decided to show himself, i went outside and he revealed himself to me. He was Lucifer. I was gapping at how beutiful he was. Not like I was attracted but I was in awe. I was so emotional and in awe that I fell to my knees and started crying while holding him. I felt that feeling deep down in my soul. I woke up and I still felt the feeling. It's one of the strongest dreams I've had. A deep part of me wants it to mean somthing.

I have currently taken distance from her but still share mutual friends.\n\nThe dream itself:\nI lived in my parents house with my family. For some reason this childhood friend also lived with us. It started with a really childish argument about what fictional character we were allowed to like. She wanted to have one of mine I have had for a long time and didn't want to give her. She ended up getting so mad she cried about how unfair it was while wrestling with me. Then she left mad and even though she didn't really say anything I knew if I did anything that made her more mad something really bad would happen to me.\n\nI saw her again in the kitchen while making food for everyone and seeing me made her so mad that she straight up said she would stab me and kill me if I did anything else. I went to my mum's room and cried to her how horrible my friend is. The whole time I was a bit scared she would hear and hurt me or someone else in my family.

    "body": "\r  \n**What is the dream meaning of not wearing clothes?**\n\nDreaming of being naked has several meanings. All are reflections of the present mind of the dreamer. It could be a problem that has been reported and needs to be fixed, or it could just be a re-enactment of what the dreamer had in mind.\r  \n\r  \nMany people believe that dream interpretation is extremely necessary because it can give you omens about the past, present or future in study, work, health, love, etc.\r  \n\r  \nTo dream that you are naked indicates that you are deliberately running away. This dream also represents being shunned, hated, afraid of being ridiculed by others.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are in a new love and dream of being naked, this dream suggests that you are nervous or afraid to express your thoughts and feelings to that person.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, this is just one of the ways to interpret the dream of seeing yourself without clothes. Because in each dream, the circumstances, details and images appear different. Therefore, in order to know the most specific and accurate omens, we must interpret separately in each specific case.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream interpretation of not wearing clothes good or bad?**\r  \nAccording to experts, dreams involving naked people often reflect things related to all your relationships. Specifically, the dream owner will meet the market in the near future. Therefore, you need to pay more attention to every word, including yourself.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming of walking but not wearing clothes**\r  \nIn your dream, you see yourself walking through a crowd of people naked. What does this undressed dream imply? This dream shows that you are a person who is easily hurt or embarrassed in front of others.\n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;See more:** [**https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/**](https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/)\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being naked in the classroom, at work**\r  \nIf you dreamed that you were naked at work, in class, such a dream indicates that you are not really ready for a certain plan. You feel stressed and confused when making decisions, especially when the attention of many people makes this problem even more serious.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream of not wearing clothes but no one notices**\r  \nIf in your dream appears the image of you naked but no one notices or notices that. This dream shows that your fears are completely unfounded. You yearn for more people to notice you.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being proud of my nudes**\r  \nIf one day you dream that you are naked but completely proud and unashamed, it is a sign that you are a free spirit. You always feel proud of yourself and your mood is always comfortable and happy.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming that I was stripped of my clothes, without a piece of cloth to cover my body**\r  \nTo dream that you are stripped of your clothes, without a piece of cloth, indicates that you have recently been entangled in some bad things, many rumors are not good for you. They make you feel humiliated and ashamed. You feel scared and worried if you let other people know. What you need to do is stay calm so you can handle things."

Not a single sting, but I was still afraid of the bees and kept running, tried to keep my mouth closed to avoid swallowing bees and hoped none would end up in my eyes.\n\nThen I jumped into a small pond with crystal clear water to escape and looked up. From below I could see the swarm on the surface and it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I don't know if the swarm was big or if the bees hovered above the surface but it took a while.

    "body": "Last night I (Trans MtF 23) had a dream, where I was a cisgendered woman (or at least seemed to be). I had an identical twin. (I don't have a twin in real life) Together we were walking down the road to go to college. (I don't go to college) There was a really bad accident at a roundabout we were crossing through, and one of the vehicles actually went up into the air, and landed partially on her. It was like something out of a Final Destination movie. Anyway, she went to the hospital in an ambulance, and while she was in the hospital, she died. The nurse accused me of murdering her, because she was apparently getting better. I left the hospital, crying and went to a restaurant across the street. I was too upset to eat, but my abusive ex wife came over to talk to me. She offered me a ride home, and I hesitantly accepted. Her passenger car door and window were both broken, and I had to stick my arm out the window and hold onto the door from the outside to keep it closed.

    "body": "Hi for some background context my dad has been dead since 2010. I was 9 when he passed so I've spent more of my life without him than I did with him, and the rest of my family has/had a much closer relationship to him. I always lived with my mother while he traveled for work and only visited us occasionally. I wasn't even a person, or I didn't feel in control of my actions yet when he passed away (by suicide). The manner of death has caused me to feel a kind of way and re-evaluate all the interactions I remember having with him which tend to skew negative. Like I feel guilty for not wanting to do something because maybe if I did he wouldn't have or I feel angry that he didn't try to see me grow up. Anyway I know that's not my fault but that is easier to say than it is to believe. \n\nI continue to have complicated feelings about it to this day, but basically today is his birthday and in a month will be the 13 year anniversary of his death. This may have stirred things up because I was keeping myself aware of it so that I could text my mom and offer comfort if she needed it. However, I've never had a dream directly about him before now. If anything, it was mentioned in passing or was implied, but I never had physically seen him in my dreams that I can remember. And since its been over a decade we don't really feel impacted by the anniversary unless its like a big one. \n\nNow onto the dream. In the dream I was myself as a child, probably around the age that he died and we were in a house I was unfamiliar with. So in my early childhood, my parents were off and on and in this dream my dad came home with a new girlfriend. She seemed nice enough and really supported him to the point of slightly disliking myself, my sister, and my mom. But this led to us not liking her all that much, so it was suggested that I scare her. I put on some three part black outfit, I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be and hid behind a door. When she opened it, I kinda hissed but I didn't get a reaction. Then I think one of them said they were going to take our cat (or I felt like it was implied that they were going to hurt it - which is not something he would do as a person but mirrors a situation where I thought he had cremated our cat when I was very young) so I was naturally very mad and upset. I grabbed the cat and ran into a bedroom, I did not see my dad for the remainder of the dream nor did he say anything else, but I remember that I suddenly felt the anger, sadness, and disappointment he felt about me and my actions. I started crying unconsolably for several minutes because it felt like he would never forgive me. \n\nThen it was like a hard cut to a school theatre play I was doing tech for (so random but I did do this in middle school). I thought he would come out to at least support me, but when I walked outside to find my parents after it was done, I only saw my mom. I began crying super hard again which is when my mom introduced me to some guy that I don't recognize from my real life. But again I had the feeling that he knew my dad and he was trying to console me by telling me about a similar situation he had been in or something. That's when I got a phone call and woke up, but I just feel super gross and really bad about the dream and would like to understand it. Is it just a manifestation of that scenario that actually happened or something deeper? Also like why now?"

We began having light conversations, and it felt like I was doing well, but not accepted yet. For some reason, the gate for the small paddock was suddenly realised to be open, and some of the goats had began slowly grazing outside of it. I realised I could put the goats back in, and that would be possible the family would accept me. I ran over, guided the goats back inside, bar one. This one would not move and I picked her up. That's when I realised she was giving birth. I helped her and the birth was quick, within seconds. I turned to the family grinning, only to be faced with scowls and hushed talking I couldn't hear under their breaths to one another. \n\nThen I unfortunately woke up to my alarm for work.

I had bought a very old run down house with old furnishings etc still there, it looked to have been well lived in but completely abandoned with everything still there. It was like a maze too, so many rooms and floors. I was exploring the house and trying to do a bit of tidying up, when in one of the bathrooms I found a bath that was part of the structure, like an old Roman type bath maybe. I turned the water on to try and test it to make sure it actually worked, when water started flowing into the bath a massive bunch of spiders (huge spiders üò≥üò≥) came running out the wall attached to the bath. I freaked out and turned the water off, they ran back into the wall. Left the room and explored more, went into another room and found a large bunch of cats that were mostly feral but they were actually very healthy looking. Some of them were friendly, others were hissing at me, others were distant but curious. First thought was to call SSPCA as a bunch of abandoned cats, wanted them to be rescued and checked over by a vet. Went exploring a bit more and in another room I found a bunch of dogs, all pretty friendly thankfully and looking healthy. Then in another room I found a mixed bunch of cats and dogs with some rabbits in the mix, all very friendly and coexisting together peacefully and looking healthy. In this room there was also a good amount of those massive spiders on the wall. Very bizarre and has left me a bit confused"

When I woke up, I did not know if it actually occurred or was just a dream. At one point during the dream I became self aware that I was dreaming and I wanted it to keep going as long as possible. However I had no control over what was happening in the dream, everything kept going and I just went along with it. So in this dream, I was myself as I am (20f) and I was the girlfriend of a famous singer (20m). I wont say who he is because none of you will know who he is and also its not really relevant. Now something about this singer, he‚Äôs the complete opposite of me and when they say opposites attract I used to never believe in that kind of stuff but for some time now I have been attracted to him like if he was a literal magnet. I am completely mesmerized. Because I am fascinated by his personality and lately I have learned a lot about myself even if it‚Äôs just from having on a crush on this guy. In the dream, it was the night of his concert, and I felt amazing. Let me tell you something about myself: I am very shy, serious, not the type to even enjoy a concert, but here in my dream I was having the time of my life! I felt safe and secure despite being in a large crowd. I felt an overwhelming amount of confidence which I have never experienced in real life. Then the singer (my boyfriend in my dream) took me backstage. And basically I just felt completely in love with him and he was obsessed and in love with me as well?!Again, this guy is very different from anyone I have ever felt interest in real life. And it‚Äôs not just because he‚Äôs famous or whatever, it‚Äôs because of his personality: his carefree laidback attitude, his ability to make friends easily, and the way he‚Äôs relaxed and easygoing about life is polar opposite from me. The dream ended when I began to realize I was dreaming. It ended off by him bringing me onto stage with him and introducing me to the crowd as his girlfriend. The crowd went wild and began screaming in excitement. And that‚Äôs the end. So can someone help me understand what this means?! I‚Äôm a girl who just stays at home reading books and never goes out at all, and suddenly I have the most intense realistic dream of my entire life where I am a rockstar‚Äôs girlfriend? Help Lol"

A woman enters through a doorway, wearing a teal dress of intricate design and patterns, shiny with inlaid gems of blue, and takes a seat next to me. She holds out her hand and tells me to take it. I oblige and after a few seconds she asks if I could feel anything yet, and as I say no I felt our connection vibrate and glow blue and suddenly I am somewhere pitch black and confused.

He said LOOK AT YOU, ARE YOU A COWARD? Pushing past the fear I muster \"I'm not a coward, I'm A FUCKING WARRIOR!\" And he says THEN GET UP AND START ACTING LIKE ONE! And I leapt up to my feet and bellowed a terrible roar as if to challenge heaven itself, my body ripped and muscles and veins bulging and a readiness to tear evil limb from limb. I realize no one is there, and I fade from that state of consciousness. I awaken on my back yet off the ground somewhere outside, a medium sized tree in the background, but I was surrounded by several figures. I didn't move. Only one of the figures looked human, like the ideal form of man but seemingly made of concrete. He wore a skull cap and trousers and a slight smirk. The rest I can hardly describe, but two of them in front of me looked vaguely humanoid, one had one eye and one had too many. They all held jars in their hands at center height. I start to fade out again as the figures close in around me with their jars and sticking my limbs in them and then I wake up on the barstool again next to the woman. She tells me I did well and I ask her who the statue man was, she said that was Adam.

the star will glow for 1 minute and disappear,so is safe to hide when that happens,describing my dream world perfectly is hard, because there is still a lot of places that i dont have reached yet, a simple description is a huge mass of land with a really tall spike mountains in the center, there are forest,plains,caves,swamps,deserts and really cold places, in the center,where the mountain is,there is a huge city in there,in one of my dreams i remember entering the capitol and there being a huge map of the world in there,a lot of places are unknown, there are varius cities and villages, and ruins too in the south east there is a village where you can reach a ocean,but the ocean from my dream world is weird,cause is alive,not like alive with fish and plants, the ocean itself is a sentient being, it will move around the continent from time to time,so the people living there settled around places were it tends to stop for at least 2 days, is full of life too, there are fish plants and the like but there is not ocean floor,only the void from below the continent. it can get agressive too if people hunt to much fish from it or when the red star is shining, so it will tend to destroy villages close to the cliff borders of the continent. the days are kinda normal,the sky is black but there is light from the suns,clouds and rains.but like in the earth where the atmosfere is blue that dont happen there,about the era of civilization is weird, some cities are modern,some are from the past, and there are no airplanes, or methods to travel in the sky, only cars,horses or being in the ocean when is moving around the continent. in one of the cities around north there is a huge bridge,is really long and big,people can cross it without problem, i have seen another continent in the other side,but i cant cross it,i have died already 3 times trying crossing it,the first i was shot by a robber,i could feel my blood flowing from my wound and the loss of my senses, when i died that time i was only 11 years old, so i got really scare,another time i was crossing in a car and around halfway the bridge huge shadow arms came from below the bridge and pushed me and others cars to the void, other time i tried again and before reaching on foot halfway the bridge the red star appeared and i got killed by the monsters, it was not painful lucky me,but up close they are hideous,they where decaying and not humanoid like,they where a deformity if you could say. after dying 3 times crossing i havent tried anymore,or at least,any more dreams close to that bridge havent appear anymore. i have die more times but in other places, one place is a part where there is a crater and inside that crater is a forest,in the middle is a lake with a perpetual tornado in it, i think i was around 8 years old when in a dream i died there,i could feel the tornado picking me up and throwing me really far away and before i crashed to the ground i woke up sweating.i remember a small urban zone in the top of the crater with grave holes empty and various persons around,they didnt say anything about the empty graves. in the city there are always a lot of persons,persons that i dont know or have seen in my life,they can talk,interact and have feelings,but when i ask about the other continent or about the weird red star they get dead silent and the surrounding too,they stop blinking and it gets creepy and unconfortable,so i tend to leave or change the topic quickly. is a extensive place, i dare say that i have explored only 10 or 20% of that place,and mostly cities,villages,forest or ruins.some ruins give me a bad vibe and a feeling that i should leave,one of the most impactful ruins i visited was a long passage around 2 cliff that was dark,in the wall there where various statues of persons really huge,they all where without head,only bodies,and they where tall like a 5 floor high building, in the end of the passage there was a big stone wall with bones and a broken door, inside that area there was thousands of giants bone arms reaching the sky from the ground, there was a heavy fog around and i got a feeling that i was being observed,in the middle there was something behind the fog that was looking me, i got chills and gose pumps around my body and something was telling me inside to run, so i did and in the passage i hear a creepy and chilly scream coming from there that woke me up scared and crying, it was around  when i was 10 or so  it gived me a scare.there is even more but it would be really long, what i want to know is,why i cant cross that bridge,and why the place is that weird?. oh and about the dreams that dont hapen in that place,they happen in earth and tends to be really cosmic like."

    "body": "I graduated from school recently. So in my dream I was also having a graduation, but it was on a cruise ship. The ship was deep into the sea when a tidal wave came and knocked the ship over. I was inside in my room when all this happened, but I had an aerial view of the disaster.\n\nI hit my head I fainted. It must‚Äôve been days later when I woke up. I could tell that I was deep deep in the ocean. I‚Äôve always been kind of a loner, so, when I got out of my cabin and looked everywhere, no one was there. The first few floors were completely flooded. I had no way to get out even if I wanted to. If I could get out where would I go? Even if I had special equipment, I doubt I would be able to make it. The pressure of the water would probably kill me first. Then it would likely be the nitrate bubbles from swimming upwards too fast. Even if I somehow made it up to the surface alright, I‚Äôd be lost in the middle of the sea. So I had no choice but just wait. I ate the food that was still okay to eat. \n\nI think I passed down in the dream. Because in the later parts, I had a swim outside the ship and get some food that was just outside. I work at a Bakery in real life and that‚Äôs the food that was there. Cakes and croissants that are just looking nasty from being underwater but I had to get them. One of the head chef‚Äôs for my job was there helping me."

    "body": "So to start off, I‚Äôm a 30-something male married to a 30-something female. I hardly ever remember my dreams. Like, ever. That‚Äôs why this is strange to me that I remember this one. In fact, during the dream, it felt so much like reality that when I woke up, I thought that I was dreaming.\n\nI‚Äôm not particularly proud of the dream, although I‚Äôm very curious of its meaning.\n\nThe dream: \nI don‚Äôt remember much about the setting now, the colors, etc. but I recall there being two sofas in a room. The room was relatively small, I‚Äôm thinking maybe 12-14 foot wide by 20 foot long, can‚Äôt remember the height though I feel like the ceilings were low. The space felt sort of cozy. On one of the sofas was my wife, alone‚Ä¶ she may have been sleeping there, can‚Äôt recall. On the other sofa was me and another female. I don‚Äôt recall a face (other than thinking she was gorgeous) or a name. The only thing I really remember is that she had tattoos that were very deep in meaning to her. One I was so intrigued about was on her upper chest. I can‚Äôt remember the subject matter in the tattoo now but I do remember that it was rectangle in shape and the subject matter existed inside of the rectangle. I almost feel like it was a cup or a kettle on a stove. I do remember the other tattoo, it was on her right hand and wrist, like ocean coral and shells. It was vibrant and detailed. I can recall a feeling in the dream. Like this other female was an acquaintance but we both felt something for each other while feeling like I was trying to be discreet about that with my wife directly across from us. I don‚Äôt recall doing anything necessarily inappropriate other than sitting extremely close. \n\nFurther context: I will admit, I‚Äôve felt lonely for a while now. My wife doesn‚Äôt come to bed with me and when she does, she never sleeps close to me or really acknowledges that I exist there. Sometimes I wake up when she‚Äôs getting into bed but I‚Äôll lay there with my eyes closed to see if she acknowledges me at all‚Ä¶ and no, she just lays there, turned the other way on her cellphone. She‚Äôs usually good otherwise, taking care of the kids, the house‚Ä¶ we have fun together, but it feels more like a roommate dynamic (even with our children) now rather than a marriage.\n\nCan anyone help to decipher this dream in some way? I probably wouldn‚Äôt really care if I remembered more of my dreams. I just find it quite odd that this is one I do remember. Thank you."

I ran into my parents there for some odd reason. This old but fashionable woman that I didn‚Äôt know approached me and complimented a fur coat I was wearing. I said thank you. Later I went back to my room to discover that the door was open. The old woman came out carrying another coat of mine, and offered to trade this fur vest in exchange for the other coat. I told her that I didn‚Äôt want the vest but she could just have the coat anyway since I didn‚Äôt really like it anyway. Throughout the beginning of the dream she kinda just kept popping up where I was and being super kind to me. Later I was just hanging in my hotel room and checked my bank balance and it was less than I‚Äôd thought but the statements were consistent with where I‚Äôd been so I figured I‚Äôd just spent more than I thought. My card was still in my wallet. I checked again later and my balance just kept dropping and dropping. I tried to freeze my account but my bank app kept loading. It felt like those dreams where you‚Äôre trying to run but it feels like you‚Äôre running through molasses. And I kept trying to freeze it just watching the balance drop not knowing what to do. I called the police but they told me I‚Äôd never get my money back even if I pressed charges.

My friend is there and we get in there together in this big hall. (At this point it‚Äôll get even more random guys) Things went fine for a while until there‚Äôs one guy looks kinda nerdy try to steal stuff from my friends like pickpocket something like that. I happened to record a VDO of him and then I got into the ‚Äòbig fight‚Äô with that guy since I told him off but he still trying to steal my friends stuff it got very bad until police came and they escort me to backroom and they make me explain my self to the chief police which is my English teacher in my high school. It went fine since we kinda knew each others beforehand and I got the footage of the guy stealing. But I still got thrown in Jail for like a day due to me creating and destroying public property (Imagine got into the fight when there‚Äôre thousands of chair and tables) So I slept through it and when I wake up, (Ok guys this will get even more random) there‚Äôre 2 actress (I‚Äôm not gonna tell you who but they are really pretty) and suddenly come to pick me up. As I‚Äôm preparing to leave they undressed themselves like completely naked and look at me and then walk away from the cell I‚Äôm in.

But I can‚Äôt find any wounds or any evidence at that point I was alone so I walked out of that station until I opened the door I suddenly arrived at the hall that are about to have a show (I don‚Äôt know why but it‚Äôs pretty random) saw a few people setting things up but I didn‚Äôt really care and walk to another side of the hall and I open this door and suddenly I have arrived to my grandparents house‚Ä¶ no one was there so I remember that I call this another actress (again wtf) to ask her where is my car I don‚Äôt know why it gotta be her but she told me that to look at the yard so I walked off to the yard just to find my self a white male in late 20‚Äôs or early 30‚Äôs who black hair with light beard and good looking guy drive a green Cadillac car and then got out and chase me with a gun I called 911 but when they picked up it was simply too late I have to got on my knees and then he shot me in the head. \n\nThis will be the most random things you guys will see today lol."

Sure enough, it starts to make me float and I begin to protect myself by repeatedly saying ‚ÄúI am divinely protected‚Äù, but this entity is trying to silence me by muffling my words, and I have fight to speak and get the words out. I can feel that I am physically restrained when trying to speak too. I have to fight, and sincerely resist this force and cannot be overtaken by it.\n\nThis time, however I‚Äôm adding in the lines ‚ÄúI banish you back to hell from whence you came‚Äù ‚Äúbe gone‚Äù, and I recall the entity gets forced down a hall and into room, where the door shuts. I am still floating by force, and it seems another entity has showed up.\n\nI turned my attention to it and I keep doing the same thing‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve forgotten how it ends but I woke up.\n\n\nThe first time I had this dream of being forced into the air and was floating, it took place in some attic with high, vaulted ceilings, and the entity looked to be cloaked in black and was also floating. I had only been in that attic dreamscape once before, first time no entity present, and sometimes I go back to it and realize it‚Äôs not a good place to be &amp; will wake myself up.\n\nThe forced floating sensation, and being unable to speak feels real, I feel I am physically resisting something.\n\nBut yeah, I keep having these dreams and this last one was far more intense and too close of an interaction for my comfort. \n\nI am not a member of an organized religion, and this entity seems like it may be part of one."

I can‚Äôt even recognize the feelings, they‚Äôre unrecognizable - just a momentary glimpse of the other side, of the other feelings.  \n\nSo extreme and vivid, in one dream, on a roof on a building, again, reality is morphed, but still recognizable. I was with someone, it wasn‚Äôt love. The feeling, of everything. How our sociality confounded itself in this dream, how it linked together, the epitome - essence of it, you could feel it. So beautiful. They and I‚Ä¶ we knew each other. The aftertaste is so beautiful and vivid. So entrancing and consuming, it absorbs me with each phase of thought and every note. So inexplicable. I find myself enslaved but it, like a cleansing rain it washes over the me, this indescribable feeling. the most INTENSE feeling on this planet. I can taste the aftertaste, the glimpses are so beautiful, before it becomes lost to a black void I can only barely remember.  \n\nThe feelings, of equilibrium like in some of my dreams, in some dreams, it‚Äôs the strongest ever, Very vivid. The environment and it‚Äôs entirety plotted out in semblances of quintessence. The aftertaste lying in bed is one of the best feelings ever. When I woke up, I felt a longing, a desire for something that isn't possible. It‚Äôs so ecstatic. I felt a strange euphoria and happiness. I could taste the afterthought of the emotion, but couldn't connect it to an existing physical meaning like with normal emotions.  \n\nEvery second of my life I spend longing for the dreams, I oversleep so often, just hoping that the feelings return.

We got a call from one of our friends (who it was is unknown, but the feeling was \"friend\") who let us know they had a dream that the world was about to end. \n\nWe looked online to see if there was anything going on, and basically there was a sudden countdown timer for, like, 5 minutes until doomsday. There wasn't any specific event that was predicted, just The End and everyone would die. \n\nI went through all the stages of grief in my dream in a very short time and before we knew it, my husband I were just holding each other waiting for The End (or not). I didnt think it would happen until my consciousness saw a massive red dust wave just whoosh across the planet (i was omniscient for a moment) in about 4 seconds, then i saw it over his shoulder coming for us, and then it was all black. \n\nThe next thing that happened is I was a thought, all encompassing, in the cosmos. I had no body, no form, just consciousness. I spoke to my husband there and also everyone else on earth who had died- we were all one with private conversations happening simultaneously. We thought, \"hey, this isn't so bad!\" Until a giant blackhole opened in the heart of the very universe itself and the universe started imploding. \n\nWe all watched as planets, stars, images of war, memes, ideas, everything material and not material that we know (but was MADE into an image being sucked in, it had a physical symbol, if that makes sense) was destroyed until the edges of the universe closed in on us like a pool of water going down a drain. \n\nNothingness. But obviously, I didn't know because I wasn't there. Next thing that happened, I woke up next to my husband and a similar day replayed- but I had given him a trinket during the 5 minute doomsday countdown, and he still had it with him so we remembered everything that had just happened and it was over. \n\nMy initial thoughts are stress, but I FELT so high, so free, so powerful being in the cosmos. It was a physical feeling in my body of just lightness. And the reborn, the symbolism, the trinket- it seems a bit deeper to me. \n\nThank you in advance!"

    "body": "for context, me and my boyfriend are in about a 1 and a half month relationship and we do absolutely everything together. he is my best friend and i am his. although we are so close our relationship is a bit rocky, we had an incident in the first week of our relationship where i caught him asking another girl to keep in touch with him, but he swears up and down he didn‚Äôt cheat. he is a bit overly sensitive when it comes to things like this, therefore i cannot ask him what he thinks about it. \n\nthe dream i had was that i was out in the countryside, with my toddler brother and i and a teddy bear with a panda body and a baby face. my boyfriend is very close to my brother. we go to an area which is a huge garden, with leaves all around and i go to pick flowers for my boyfriend even though he isn‚Äôt too keen on flowers. the instructor tells me that the nicer flowers are behind this bush, and pushers it away slightly to show me. the bush is spikey, and when the abundance of flowers are revealed. there were so many, and they were alive but some seem to not be in the best condition. the flowers in the dream were daises.  as i was picking them, my arms getting all scratched up and stung from the bush, my boyfriend sends me a snap of him entering the gym with a girl. he says ‚Äújust going to the gym with Patina/Paynita/Paysina‚Äù (i‚Äôm guessing the name because it was something along those lines). i remember getting a bit jealous as he normally wouldn‚Äôt be going anywhere with a girl one on one, but brushed it off as being overprotective. I remembered then not replying to the message. about a few bit later (roughly 10-15-20-30 minutes) he sends me a photo of him and her in bed half naked, her laying with her legs bent and on his right ride with the blanket draped over her body, the same blanket that i have. \n\nthank you so much for reading, i really hope i can find out the meaning of this dream."

She made me and 2 more friends come along because she didn't want to go alone. We ended up going through the sewers and then I realised me and my friend (the party invitee) didn't have shoes on, the other two friends did though. When we get to the party, we see there are m&amp;m cookies so we (me and the other barefoot girl) start eating them all, our friends tell us not to. Then we realise it's a yacht party for amputees and we're showing off our bare toes. This creates a big scandal, and also we've eaten all of their cookies.\n\n\nPs, I've never been on a yacht, I've never been to Dubai, and I don't like going barefoot\"\n\nAny insight is appreciated!"

The snake was just stationary surrounded by logs. In the dream, this was the second time coming across a similar huge snake (so in total I saw two but not at the same time).\n\nThere was also a crocodile? Alligator? Slowly crawling/moving towards straight to the shore from the shallow waters/sea. But then it suddenly turned to their left &amp; towards us (me and some random people I don‚Äôt know, maybe there were 2-3 of us and a puppy with white fur named ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù). It swiftly attacked and snatched the puppy when it approached our area. The puppy was yelping. We felt helpless but its name ‚ÄúLucky‚Äù kept repeating in my head. ‚ÄúLucky. Lucky. The puppy is lucky!‚Äù So that gave me the courage to help free the puppy from the alligator/crocodile. I told the other people I was with to help so they did. We freed the puppy after I kept hitting the croc/gator and we were forcing its jaws open."

    "body": "I typically struggle to remember by dreams, but, last night, I recall pieces of a dream that I had. I was hiking in a desert area, when I came across a rattlesnake. In the dream, it kept trying to bite me. Eventually, the rattlesnake's head was separated from its body. I think I might've had some type of sword/knife/stick that I was using to defend myself, and I may have slashed its head off in the dream, but I don't remember that happening. \n\nI continued to dream that, after I did this, the snake's body continued to lunge at me. The head, separate from the body, also kept moving toward me, somehow moving in a slithering motion, but also bouncing at times. I don't remember if I dreamt it bit me-- I believe in the dream that it either did, or came close. It kept flashing its fangs at me threateningly.\n\nSome context-- I'm a 26-year old male in a graduate program. Recently, I've been struggling after a friend of mine took their own life about a month ago. I wonder if the dream has anything to do with that. Another important piece of context is that I'm not really afraid of snakes. I'm terrified of spiders and scorpions, but I've always been fascinated by snakes (except for the gross muscle-y constrictor snakes) and don't have any type of phobia of them."

I saw other people wearing similar shirts and asked if they could help, and other people brought me similar shirts but it was never the right one. I recognized some of them I think but I don't remember them. I looked EVERYWHERE 10 times over. And then I went into a room where a girl was cutting up meat with a knife and I held up a chunk of meat and it had my name on it, like a video game item almost, and I was like this is me. This is what happened to my shirt. Turned into meat apparently. And then I held up the knife which also had my name on it and said this is also me, and I looked at the girl and said you were cutting up my flesh with a piece of me.

    "body": "So, I (21f) was in some random school, a bit like my old one, but with big differences like wallpaper colour and the addition of a cafeteria. Also I heard this weird clanging, like 2 frying pans or something.  Anyway, I went to the cafeteria for some reason but then all the tables moved to the sides of the room and some blonde little girl (probably around 15) wearing a pink cardigan and beige skirt popped out from an archway that led to the library.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAt this point she mouthed hi then pulled out like a modern pistol and shot at me. (should probably add that I've never seen this girl before). I dodged it and she ran away. I just stood there then she came out the other door that led to the hallway I just came threw. She kept swapping doors for a good 5 minutes then I heard all the faculty yelling. They were all running down the hallway but they weren't able to move past a certain point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a getting shot at a few more times, I picked up a fire extinguisher and used it to block a bullet before throwing at her. She got dazed so I tried to tackle her, but she managed to finally hit me, right in the middle of the tip of my middle finger. I looked at the wound and it was less of a bullet hole and more of a really big pin prick that was bleeding rather fast. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a few seconds the blood reached my wrist and I looked to where the girl was, but she wasn't there. Then I looked at the wound again, the blood had reset to just a normal looking streak coming out of the hole. After that it just faded to black and I woke up.

    "body": "I‚Äôm not even sure what the best word to describe it is so I‚Äôll just give as much detail as I can and hopefully it makes sense.\n\nThe dream started with me in a room beside a basement (a bedroom not unlike my brother used to have)\n\nAnd basically I was asked not to leave that room.\n\nBut quickly I found myself tormenting by some demonic force that was doing weird things like making faces on the walls and making it appear the door was gone so I couldn‚Äôt leave.\n\nThe details don‚Äôt matter but just keep in mind I was being tormented by this demonic force and it scared me enough I really didn‚Äôt want it to happen again.\n\nBecause that becomes important later.\n\nSuddenly the dream cuts to me sitting side by side with a woman I‚Äôve known since middle school. One of my closest friends and someone I‚Äôve always loved.\n\nSomehow I instinctually knew that on some spiritual level we were (for a lack of a better term) both drawing the same energy.\n\nIf life was some magnetic axis, she and I are both north (or both south)\n\nBoth Yin or both Yang.\n\nAnd for this reason I knew that the two of us being together meant we were drawing in the same type of energy, making it positive, and the demonic force could never return because of this.\n\nThink of it like we‚Äôre slowly building up our ‚Äúki‚Äù and it‚Äôs acting like a force field.\n\nBut not just for stopping evil things but it felt like luck in general.\n\nLike somehow I knew my chances of random bad things happening like stubbing my toe or a tire blowing out all the way up to heart attacks would be lower\n\nAnd random good things like stumbling across a winning lottery ticket would be higher.\n\nI went to pay her some platonic compliment and I felt she took it the wrong way because she responded ‚ÄúI just need more time‚Äù as if she just recently divorced or lost her husband.\n\nAt this point the dream cuts to me walking into the house of a blonde girl that looks like a movie star I‚Äôve always admired, and when she looked her best too.\n\nShe took my hand and introduced me as her boyfriend which thrilled me.\n\nBut then it‚Äôs like a silent narrator just telepathically told me that despite how good she is (physically, mentally, emotionally) something about her (in an almost horoscope bullshit sort of way) meant she was on the other axis.\n\nNot even just neutral but one that would be negative and drain all that good juju I had built up earlier.\n\nRight then I knew if I stayed with her it would be constant misfortune. No chance at the lottery , if anything I‚Äôd get robbed randomly and lose money.\n\nNot because she‚Äôs bad in any way (I can‚Äôt emphasize that enough) but because she just brought bad luck.\n\nSo she tried to lead me up stairs , a moment I‚Äôve probably wished would happen with this actress in dreams for years but all I could think about was that the demon from earlier would pop out at any moment now.\n\nMy protection was gone and would soon become anti-protection (like a beacon for bad things)\n\nBut I wanted to stay with her anyway. \n\nAs I type this the meaning seems almost too obvious. The first girl is the right girl. But can it really be that simple?"

It was so vivid that it has been years and I can't still forget about it.\n\nI was walking in the middle of the street, within the crowd and there was a man following me. Rather than feeling threatened, I felt comfortable and safe instead. I was much older there, around mid-20s. Same for the man who seemed to be in his late 20s. There were stalls at the side and there are some people selling various things like the ones you can see when you go to a night market. Both of us were wearing pants and shirts and he has a clean cut of hair. I had a long straight hair there, my curly hair is inborn.\n\nAnd then, while we were walking, we were just looking around, sight-seeing, having smiles on our lips while enjoying the surroundings. After some minutes, we finally arrived at the destination. It was at the countryside and there was a house made of wood and cement there. The house is built under a huge tree and at the side, you can see the rice fields. \n\nWe went inside the house. It is actually fully furnished but it looked like it was being abandoned after a celebration. You can see the food sitting on the table, untouched. You can see confetti on the floor, the balloons, the decorations still hanged up on the walls. And then, we went inside a certain room and we saw a bunch of baby items like blankets, clothes, etc. In every clothing there, the baby's name is embroidered. The man and I didn't really talk at all, throughout the whole time but when I picked up one of the blankets, we smiled lovingly while looking at the embroidered name.\n\nSometimes, I believe that this man from my dream is actually the right person for me but still, I haven't seen him yet."

I literally have no complaints whatsoever.\n\nWell.... but there was this dream. In my dream, I found out that my partner had been hiding some crucial information under her bed. I opened her laptop and took a look at some documents. I saw pictures of at least two women that she had killed by drugging them up.

But there were pills attached to the pictures (inside of little plastic bags) and I just KNEW that they were her victims.\nNext thing I see is my partner entering the room and I pretended to not have seen anything.\nI knew that she was planning to do the same with me eventually. It was her method of killing people: By entering relationships with them and making them feel safe and loved, not thinking anything bad of it all. \n\nI felt so disappointed and betrayed and also fearful..... when I woke up, I couldn't remember the dream at first, but then it hit me. And it's been haunting me the whole day now. I have no idea why I would dream such a thing. I'm not lying to you, I have ZERO negative feelings about my partner. I have no suspicions or anything.

Now I can‚Äôt remember ever seeing what the front of the pendant looked like, I just remember holding it up to others and seeing the back of it, getting an idea of what it looked like. But I have more of a feeling that the pendant was some kind of green color, and it had metal swirls around it, the pendant itself was circular. Now nothing ever happened to me when I held it, but I felt like I had to be it‚Äôs protector, it‚Äôs keeper, because I‚Äôm the hands of everyone else it gave off a really bad vibe of like evil, or angry energy coming off of it. When it was in the hands of those who touched it though, their faces kind of distorted. They went to like a weird shape and than back to a whole new constructed face. They didn‚Äôt look bad or anything, just unrecognizable and like they‚Äôre someone completely new. I‚Äôm the end of this dream I ripped the pendant out of someone‚Äôs hand and kept it myself and said I was gonna take the pendant and put it up in a clear frame, because of the energy the pendant was letting off.

Before I woke up I remember looking online and seeing that they were called 'cervical worms' and that tying a string to your belly button will get rid of them?

I just had a dream where i was in my apartment and there were strangers all over my house. i went over to my mom and she was talking to some of them, so was my girlfriend, so i assumed they had been invited by them and i simply didnt know them. i talked to some of them for a while, some of them were nice and others not so much, sometimes we even got along quite well, but then i went to my mom to ask her who these people were and how we know them. she said to me she has no idea. i then went to my girlfriend, posed the same question, and received the same response. at that point i loudly said hello everyone, please leave my house immediately, i don‚Äôt know any of you. i started going to each individual person and kicking them all out of my home. some of them were trying to take items, which i snatched out of their hands. once they had all left i started watching youtube or playing video games or something, when i noticed another stranger next to me commenting on what was happening on screen. i turned to them and said hey please leave my home. they left. however the more people i told to leave, more people just kept on popping up out of nowhere. it kept going for what felt like hours. some of them were even murderers that would kill some of the other strangers, often we had to run away from them. this kept going throughout what felt like the course of an entire night. by the end of it, i was traumatised, scared, and was constantly darting my eyes back and forth through the rooms of my apartment to ensure new people didn‚Äôt keep on coming in. i woke up in a sweat, terrified. this was 20 minutes ago and i‚Äôm still shook. i know it doesn‚Äôt sound particularly scary, but the whole thing had sinister overtones and just outright terrified me. thoughts?"

    "body": "Last night I dreamt about being in a place that I‚Äôve dreamt of before, though it was quite a bit different than the last time I dreamt of it. It was a place that I knew to be a really big school with a lay-out too confusing for myself to know go to get around, so it was easy to get lost/lose my bearings. The first time I‚Äôve dreamt of the school, it was a good dream.\n\nAlthough it was a school and had classrooms and a lunch room, it also had multiple different apartment buildings in it. Each apartment had a different lay-out as well as having two ways to get in and out, each leading to a hallway with multiple doors leading to more apartments, or different school rooms. There WAS a way to eventually get outside, but at one outside area you needed a vehicle to bring out out and at another side it was completely fenced in. \n\nThere was a set of twins (male and female), each having their own sword. Their purpose of being there was to protect everyone. \nMy boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) were in a lunchroom, and he grabbed a couple of beverages out of the vending machine and drank them before leaving - I grabbed one beverage out of the vending machine, and before I could open it, the lights went out. \n\n(This next part starts to get kind of graphic, so possible TW)\nI used my phone for a flashlight and found my way out of the room into the hallway and then into an apartment-style room. There I saw the two twins and some other people, but something was corrupting the twins. The twins exchanged their swords with one another and started crying blood before cutting the side of the other‚Äôs neck just enough to bleed. Immediately after, the twins started killing everyone in the room - I was in a bit of shock, but then left the room to run into a different room.\n\nI could hear the door to the room the twins were in open and then close, so I kept running to find the door in the room to bring me into the next one away from them. It was also at this point that I somehow knew that my 5yo son was around somewhere as well, so I was also running to try and find him. \n\nThere was one room I ran into but couldn‚Äôt find the way out of the other side of it, so I hid in a closet. The twins came into the room, and while looking in the bathroom I ran out to a different one. I eventually ran into someone else that was hiding in a closet with my son - he was so terrified that he couldn‚Äôt make a sound but he looked like he was trying to scream - I think he thought I might have been the twins until he realized that it was me instead. \n\nUpon the realization, he clung to me. The woman that was hiding with him said she had found him hiding under a super low shelf - I then asked her if it was super obvious that he was hiding there and she said that she didn‚Äôt realize he was there until he came out once he realized that t was a safe person. I was relieved upon hearing that.\n\nWe knew that we had to keep going to stay ahead of the twins, so we looked for the other door that would lead out. I noticed in the closet there was a little bit of a platform higher up, so. Lifted my son up there, but he was scared saying ‚Äúno, no, no‚Äù - I reassured him we were all going to go together, but that he had to go first and I would follow and the seemed to do the trick.\n\nI went up next, and then the other woman followed. I realized there were dim lights on that we could not turn off and I was worried that we would be found from that alone if we stayed, so I looked around and noticed the closet went further down (but only in this upper part) and that there was a door on the other side. We all went through to find ourselves in another room. We went through quite a few more rooms before coming across one with a lot of other people inside. \n\nEveryone here seemed to be under the impression that they were safe, so they had music playing very loud and were hanging around like there wasn‚Äôt any danger lurking. I put my son up into the top of the closet as it had a deep upper part that went further than the  closet itself before going down and unplugging the music and telling them they were endangering everyone there. They told me to stfu and that they were fine, and then plugged the music back in. \n\nI went into the top of the closet but did not see my son - he was down below looking for me, so I grabbed him and brought him up with me. We then hid in the super far back near the door to the next room. Someone was pacing back and forth in that room, and I woke up as I was going to go through the door to talk to them."

    "body": "Last night, a portion of my dream was devoted to being cut in half.\n\nIf anyone is familiar with the series Chainsaw Man, I was taking the place of the main character Denji. I was running away from a threat with some allies in a metropolitan setting. The threat appeared to be a fairly normal looking young adult woman who appeared to have gone wild and enraged from stress. Her demeanor kind of matched how I've been wanting to vent my anger and frustration internally after how the last couple of years have left me feeling unfulfilled and completely alienated. I can place anger towards others, but I cannot place blame on them or myself for what has happened. I can't hate anyone over it.\n\nThe only thing abnormal about this woman was the immense strength she used with a knife to gruesomely cut diagonally through my torso and right arm, right on through to the person on my left as well. Both of us went down and I was very aware of the fact that my legs were no longer attached to my body.\n\nIn the moment, I was taking in how rough the wounds felt. The woman had mounted over my body to impale me a few, slow times. Despite this, I felt very calm and I did not actually feel in danger at all. It didn't feel like murder. My head on its side against cobblestone could look up to see the woman with a quivering expression of wild anger. Tears rolled down her cheeks, her eyes trying not to cry themselves shut. Strained giggles escaped her between sobs.\n\nI only really sensed a budding empathy for her. As the dream started to wrap up, I felt mostly calm and safe. I knew that in a dream, it was a safe space for these ugly emotions to come out. Though really, I don't got much of my own ideas for why I was cut in half, and I am curious to know what others think of this."

I got freaked out when I did some research after waking up to find that this is basically exactly what happens during a nuclear explosion. I even checked a map online to see the radius of an explosion if it happened in the city center and it was similar to my dream."

He said we had to get the kids together and that my MIL was coming over. We had 2 kids with a 3rd on the way. It was so weird to me because I remember so vividly what everyone looked like, the number of light switches by our shared bed (3 on my side, 3 on his), the color of the clothes I was wearing down to the art in the house. I remember what my MIL &amp; my FIL looked like down to their shoes. The conversations that were had, everything. My husband left to go to the store and was in an accident when my FIL showed up to tell me we had to talk about the kids, but that everything was okay and my husband would be back. We lost power in the house and when the power came back, my husband was back but FIL/MIL were gone with the kids. My husband told me everything was ok and that we had the evening to ourselves.

Currently in many categories of my life (health, finances, emotional health etc.) there have been things I have been trying to pursue and I feel like I'm a bit lost and unsure of the proper paths to take for the outcomes I'm trying to achieve. Could he mean that I actually am on the right path and to just trust in that? But why would he call it the 'map' and not the 'way' if that's the case?

Background info about my ex is below just in case it's helpful, and I do not have a preferred interpretation method. Thank you to everyone in advance.\n\n*Background on my ex: very short relationship a few years ago that didn't work out, but we eventually became best friends and have been very close for a little over 2 years now. She got back together with a guy she dated for years before me and they're married now. She and I still get physical sometimes (she says her husband is okay with it) and will even pretend to be girlfriends, so sometimes it feels like our relationship and feelings are deeper than \"just friends\".*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn my dream, I was hanging out with my ex at her house and a few random girls we had met at the bar (not girls I know in real life, my brain just made them up). I remember feeling left out and not included for most of the time. She was flirting with these girls and playing with their hair, letting them lay on her, etc. (all stuff that she typically does with me in real life). At one point, my ex asked me to go outside and get something for her (I don't remember what it was), but I went outside and it was dark because it was nighttime. I was looking for the thing she wanted me to get and I came across this snake. It was huge, mostly light green with some large black diamond shapes on it and [looked like this](https://br.pinterest.com/pin/682295412270638671/). Not sure what it actually was, but I knew for a fact it wasn't a local species where I live (Midwest U.S.) I didn't see it at first and startled it, so it hissed at me and started standing up. I backed away and told the snake, \"I'm really sorry, I didn't see you there\" and then it left me alone.\n\nThen, one of my ex's neighbors came over to me and asked me if I wanted him to kill the snake for me. Again, this isn't someone I know, my brain just made him up. I told him no and it was fine, the snake wasn't bothering me anymore and I had just startled it. I kept looking for whatever it was I supposed to be getting, and I found a second snake. This one was a lot smaller, with a brownish-red banding pattern. I'm not sure if it was a local species, but it definitely looked a lot less exotic, [sort of like this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/73683441@N07/16795702747). This time I didn't startle the snake, so we made eye contact but left each other alone and I moved on to keep looking.\n\nAfter that, this big animal that resembled a panda bear came up to me and started nibbling on my hand and grabbed onto me. It was really friendly, but it was very clingy and latched on to me with its arms and would not let go. I remember thinking that it must have been a baby that had lost its mom. I was trying to look it up on my phone to found out what type of animal it was. While I was doing that, my ex came outside to see what was taking me so long and to make sure I was okay. I told her everything that had happened and when I got done explaining, I noticed that the panda-like animal was gone. I also tried to show her the snakes, but I found them both dead on the ground tied up against a spear. The neighbor said he killed them because they were dangerous, but then I got very upset and told him that they weren't bothering anyone, this was their home too, and they didn't deserve to die. After that, my ex and I spent the rest of the dream trying to find the panda-like animal because I wanted to save it."

The cars, houses, decorations, the whole vibe of the dream. \n\nI was waiting in front off their garden when I (in the dream) remembers someone telling me to not take the medicine. I‚Äôm confused as I stand there when a car pulls up beside me. The people inside are having fun and laughing as the driver offers me a packet of prescribed medication. I decline but they continue to insist until the car I‚Äôm waiting for arrives. The others drive off. \n\nThe person?, that earlier told me not to take the medicine tells me that my ‚Äústep cousin‚Äù is taking the medicine. I get into the car that is supposed to take me to my soccer game. (I haven‚Äôt played soccer for over two years now.) Anyway we make small talk in the car when the stranger that sit beside me offers me another package of the same prescribed medication. I tell her off but she continues to insist and tells me that it‚Äôs much better and healthier to take. That it will make me feel much better. A warning flag goes off in my head and I ignore her for the rest off the ride. The driver which is someone I know (not in real life, idk who that was) then proceeds to take a wrong turn and drives to a nearby health centre.\n\nI‚Äôm confused but follows the others inside. In the centre everyone is working and the driver guide me to an office while she talks about how good and necessary the medication is. She then tells me that she‚Äôs almost finished with making the medication legal. She then offers me some of the pills. I ask to read the labels but she just laugh at my question. She then tells me to either take the pills or I will get the medicine injected. I start panicking and ask her about the soccer game. She tells me that we will go there when I take the medication. \n\nI try to look for an exit but she just laughs and yet again tells me to take the medication. She then leans down to my ear and tells me that the pills are much, much better than the injections. And that only fools take the injections. She then hands me the packet of pills. The dreams end shortly after."

I was walking along some kind of water, not sure if it was a lake, or river. I remember seeing a lot of snakes. Then we (my boyfriend and I) came upon my dog and a either a crocodile or alligator. They had my dogs leg in their mouth when I approached it it released my dog and my boyfriend tried to come behind it and grab my dog out of harms way but it turned around and grabbed my dogs leg again. It had to be shot a few time before it released my dog. We scooped up my dog and tried to rinse blood from him so I could see how bad his injuries were. Both his front legs had about half of his fur gone. Then I noticed the bite may have gotten an artery in his arm because the blood wouldn‚Äôt stop. I immediately applied pressure and screamed for someone to drive us. No one could drive and I begged someone to call 911. That‚Äôs when I woke up."

Then my dad, he starts going for a knife or gun. Then me, panicking, I take the knife and stab the knife in the abdomen and then neck I believe. (The neck is weird because before I went to bed I was watching some of The Walking Dead, where a character stabbed another in the neck.

And I‚Äôm pretty sure I was in Louisiana even though I‚Äôve never actively been in Louisiana. (I‚Äôve passed through Louisiana once.) I noticed that the trolley lines were intersecting with the regular vehicle lanes, and there were stoplights. \nThe first stoplight, I realized I was breaking too hard and not in time enough and I told myself that I need to pay attention. At the second light, my passenger side got hit with a trolley. I have a very little car IRL but the trolley was more damaged than my vehicle. Before I get out of the car, I noticed that two black, older men were conducting it. One was drinking out of a Bud Light beer can and the other man was smoking a joint. And I asked myself if my insurance good so I started freaking out and trying to find anything to use against the conductors like smoking weed and drinking alcohol while driving the trolley. So I got out and I called my mother and she‚Äôs not paying attention, she‚Äôs cutting me off, she can‚Äôt hear me, every excuse under the sun for her to explain to me at the bare minimum, that she could not grasp what I was trying to ask her.

    "body": "I am one to believe dreams have meanings but usually don‚Äôt often have nightmares or dreams that are disconcerting enough to care to find out what they mean. However I had a series of nightmares last night which weren‚Äôt entirely all that bad I think just due to a lack of vividness, though they were VERY out of the my dreaming norm and played out as a series of dreams all with the same unnerving theme.\n\nThroughout these dreams I found myself running from a sort of sinister evil or evil spirit that was hunting people down and killing them. The first dream involves me working at some unfamiliar store where people began to die spontaneously on shift but we were expected to stay. Remaining staff and I realized the cause was staring into the reflection of an old TV in the store because when doing so, intense fear and the feeling of an evil presence would wash over you. I don‚Äôt know why but I kept wanting to look into it to figure out exactly what it was and a feeling of impending doom grew each time until I finally sprinted out of the store and ran to my car and sped out of the parking lot like my life depended on it, feeling like if I wasn‚Äôt out of there fast enough, I was next.\n\nSimilar scenarios repeated in smaller dreams I had later on in the night where I kept finding myself wanting to investigate these very malevolent energies coming from reflections.  I think I wanted to investigate both out of curiosity and a hope that it would go away. One small dream involved me looking into the reflection of the sliding glass door in my kitchen and would feel waves of fear wash over me but nothing happened. Another dream didn‚Äôt involve a reflection I recall but involved me being in my house with a coworker of mine and sprinting outside to my car while desperately pleading with this coworker to come outside and get in the car with me all while they were confused and asking my why. One last related one involved my walking down the street past the store from the first dream to see if the evil energy was still there and killing the workers.\n\nFinally, this last one was a little different and didn‚Äôt feel scary to me in the moment but was very creepy and sinister in nature. I was in this very old dingy apartment that was very colorless and filled with dusty sunlight. There were a bunch of friendly but timid monsters living together on this floor I was on. They were all just lifelessly doing nothing while I was desperately searching all the rooms for something. They did not bother me until I opened a door that led to an attic above. As soon as I did all the monsters started fearfully and angrily screaming and yelling NOOO!!! NOO!!! And suddenly blood starts pouring down the stairs and I feel fear wash over me and I sprint outside and begin running from the apartment building. I look back and from a dormer window on the roof I see two creatures watching me, one large and one small- one white with large black voids for eyes and one black with large white voids for eyes. I run as fast as I can but they continue to watch me until finally from a third person perspective I watch my eyes melt out of my head and my body collapse to its knees. It felt like I turned into one of the monsters living in that place.\n\nI don't usually have dreams like this, let alone a series of them all night. I'm mostly unbothered about it but am also very curious what it all could mean if it does mean something. I'm at a relatively good place in life right now and have been doing good inner work so it's not something I would expect to be within me with this sudden intensity at this moment in time. What are your thoughts?"

So in the dream there is a 4-way rotary intersection with a central island and wide median strip on each way and my dad and I are standing on the left lane of the road whereas my mom and sister are taking the bus on the opposite lane. This is then the dream ends. I've had this same dream for many years when I was child. The intersection looked very beautiful and way too modern for that time.\n\nWhen I turned 18 or so (around year 2015) , I needed to go to a different city for some works with my dad. This is the city which is approximately 60 kms away and I had never been there. So I was driving the car and my dad was sitting on the passenger sit. The road network was in rectangular pattern and after crossing a few intersections, I was right at the same spot I used to get dreams of. It immediately clicked me that I'm on the same lane, and there is this bus coming on the opposite lane and that there is a median in between to separate the opposite traffic. Except that my mom and sister weren't there and they weren't taking the bus, it was me and my dad only there. \n\nBut everything I saw in those dreams happened right back at that time and at that intersection. I was driving my car right at the same spot I was standing in my dreams several years ago. That moment was so crazy at that time that the dejavu lasted for quite a long time until I reached at another intersection."

It was fun being an intern. \n\nOh and one other thing this news station set was very obviously in another realm sort of. It was cloudy looking, shaky and the outside looked like stars in space.

A huge gap is left open and people are able to see me. They don't look at me directly, but the gap is so huge so it's very easy for them to see. I change stalls multiple times, same thing. I always dream of this, nearly every night. Sometimes I even find myself on a toilet in the middle of a hallway.\n\nWhen people look at me, they have this very unammused, blank expression on their face. I was flying a kite and it dragged me with it because the wind was pretty strong. Started laughing, looked behind me, and they stared at me like stray cats in the dark."

    "body": "I have come here for help deciphering a reoccurring dream that I've had every night for almost 2 years now, the specifics are slightly different but generally the same vibe. Also, I take 2 types of sleeping medication so it might not even be a dream it could just be chemicals; but anyway,\n\nIt started around 2 years ago after a very stressful event. It began almost like an out of body experience, where I knew I was asleep, I always know I'm asleep, but it felt like I was drifting upwards and could see my body from above. Kinda fun but I also didn't wanna float away too far incase I never came back, it was as if i knew I couldn't float too far away because something not so nice would happen, but still kinda funky. \n\nI'm not sure when, but then they started to get darker. I'd 'wake up', open my eyes and see something in my room, and I started to feel like I was no longer floating up- but going down. I lived alone and ended up moving house where I live with other people. I thought that would make it go away but it hasn't.\n\nNow I'm not scared of it, but its more of an annoyance. I go to sleep, I wake up and I just start dream-punching whatever shadowy figure is beside me until I wake up. The imagined presence doesn't feel like some sort of evil entity, but it's also not very comforting? And it also doesn't feel like the same 'presence' each time. I just don't feel like watching me sleep is a very cool thing to do so like, get out of my house. Last night, it felt as if I was slowly being sucked off my bed and vacuumed downwards. I can always wake myself up by shadowboxing air. Maybe it's sleep paralysis, but why it happens every night I'm not sure. I have a certain trick to get rid of it, and if I do that before bed I never get those dreams- but I'm not always in the mood every single night if you get me\n\nAlso, the dreams never happen if there's someone else physically in my room, like if I'm babysitting a cat or get lucky enough to bring someone home one night.\n\nBut who the hell am I fighting in my sleep?"

    "body": "So a little backstory, me and this girl were together for 3 years and now have been apart for 10 months. I haven‚Äôt thought of her in months and I would like to say I‚Äôm pretty much over her as the relationship ended in her telling me she fell out of love with me. I was hurt at the time but moved on because I had more important things to focus on . I definitely let the breakup run its course though and worked it all out in my head and heart, as it did hurt. But like I said I haven‚Äôt though about her in months and really have no emotions connected to her anymore nor have I been in contact with her since the whole breakup. But anyways I had a really stressful and long day at work and got home early so I took a little nap. During that nap I had a dream where I ended back up at her place and in her room. The dream had a very weird atmosphere and not a good feeling to it. The vibe was definitely off. We were kind of on the opposite sides of the room but still having conversation. I don‚Äôt remember everything in full detail but I do remember her telling me how it was nice seeing me again and it almost felt like she was trying to reconnect with me. She was also saying how it was nice to be around each other again , she complemented me on my looks and was saying how I looked good. We ended up talking a bit more from what I remember but don‚Äôt remember about what exactly. But then before the dream ended‚Ä¶ I started choking , it felt like my whole throat was full of phlegm that I could not get out . After coughing and gagging trying to clear my throat I woke up. I had a really weird feeling upon waking up and everything just didn‚Äôt feel right the rest of the day. Is there any hidden message that just like flew right over my head? Or anything I should take note of? Anything helps, this was such a weird dream and experience and have never had a dream anything like this at all. Even after the breakup I never had a dream like this. Any further questions I‚Äôd be happy to answer but I‚Äôm genuinely confused as to what the dream means.

I looked up and we locked eyes. I remember thinking how cute he was and feeling intrigued by him. Then I seen him again at an event soon after - no introductions yet - but heavy attraction still/eye contact. Several months later ,I saw him again at a large parade where I remember locking eyes intensely through a huge crowd again. A couple of months after that he randomly ended up working for my former boss. We then met and the energy was intense. But nothing came of it and we haven‚Äôt come in contact since. I also learned that he might have a girlfriend.\n\nI should mention that I‚Äôve never been in a relationship before, but I‚Äôve been very open lately to share space with someone else.

Especially if you have dreamed about dying before, or even if you had a near death experience, thank you in advance-and I look forward to receiving any sort of feedback„Äã\n\n‚Ä¢My dream starts off with me and my mother sitting in a room, talking on the bed. I then fall off the bed and get some sort of head injury. I begin screaming for my mom, but she walks away to get someone else. I then starting puking this clear liquid, that was causing me issues to breath. She comes back and say \"just breathe\" then she gets on the phone to call my grandma and uncle to give us a ride to the hospital. Well they started arguing, then my mom gets mad and says forget it she's not going to help. I then remember trying to stumble out of the room- but I was unable to see properly. Like my vision was of me in some sort of dark hallway with multiple doors and stairs. I was still calling out to my mom with no help or answer. Somehow I make it outside and cops appear, and so does my mom . At this time, she appears concerned talking about \"someone help her , my baby\" It changed to me in the hospital, in a surgery room. I was awake, and the doctor put some sort of iv into my side/abdominal area. I remember that my brain had a infection, and they was trying to pump antibiotics directly into my stomach. \nThen very vividly-like this felt so real. I started puking, and choking on my own blood. I remember in the dream I felt very fearful but I was trying to stay calm and breath. Like, I felt my \"light\" fading out. I really felt death creep up, slowly. I had enough time to acknowledge the fact that I was dying, and to be scared. Briefly I tried to fight it, then I accepted-even said a small prayer to God something like \"Forgive me father, and if this is my time I accept this. Take me\" once that was said I \"fell unconscious\" in my dream and saw some sort of light. A beautiful welcoming light, i felt a sense of peace, love and longing. Like I really wanted to go, fully ready to set life aside and move on to the light. Once my \"soul\" begin leaving from my body, the dream ended and I woke up. I was very confused, and sad that I was not able to reach the light. Like my first thought was \"I wanted to go\" \n\nI'm not really sure the meaning or message of this dream,but I cannot emphasize enough on how real everything felt. When I was choking I really felt like I was losing my breath. When I was \"dying\" - I really believe I felt the presence of Death itself. Seriously, I woke up sad that I didn't die for real? How strange is that?\n\nAnyway, thank you for taking your time reading this. If you have any insights, or interpretations please leave a comment. I'd love to see how other people see the meaning behind this, or have experienced something similar."

The shark is now taunting me, it knows I'm alone and afraid and is basically just toying with me now, throwing insults, knocking me up and down. I manage to stab it a few times, and it manages to sink its teeth into my leg. I run away, but it makes its way onto land and I'm now playing hide and seek with it hoping it doesn't find me. I muster some bravery, and I succeed in confronting the shark and cutting it up into pieces, half its body still submerged in the waters right where the hole is. I keep telling my family, \"look! Look! The great white shark we've been trying to kill for generations is *right there!* why won't you help?\" They finally listen and come to the hole, but at this point the shark has already run off, though I get the sense it's only been temporarily defeated.

For some reason I got scared they‚Äôd bite me for a moment cause how tight they squeezes but it didn‚Äôt hurt just pressure like a hug (plus Ik moths don‚Äôt bite lol idk what dream me was thinking) I kept trying to gently get them off of me and let them outside to be free but they kept clinging to me and coming back?"

I (M,22), talked to this girl 2 years ago, we never officially dated, but we talked quite a bit and got pretty close physically.\n\nIt ended after a couple months and we are still friendly and Snapchat but she lives in another city so I never see her.\n\nThe dream I just had felt incredibly real and ominous. I was at a house with my buddy who set us up. I invited her there to be friendly. She ended up convincing me to let her sleep with me. However throughout the night, she began being disrespectful to me, trashing my house, and not being present. When I called her on it, she turned very cold and admitted she was using me. \n\nI told her off and she went to bed, and then the dream shifted to a party with a bunch of my friends. At this point, I was talking to one of my friends when they nudge me and point out to me she had come out of the room with a crazed look in her eye. She was (weirdly enough) trying to tickle me (or something like that) and I had to like grab her and keep her off of me, calling out to my friends to help me get her away. It was like she was possessed. When I realized I couldn‚Äôt stop her, I woke up to find myself in a bit of a sweat.\n\nThe only other thing I can remember from the dream is that I was out on the street by some bars at one point trying to get home, but my legs were hardly working, pulling me in random directions or being stuck. This feeling has occurred in many dreams before.\n\nDoes anyone see any potential meaning from this dream? Sorry if this is long.

    "body": "So for context, (23f) i just ended my situationship with someone (22m) last month because i felt like it wasn't healthy for me mentally. Afterwards i keep on dreaming about him. Sometimes 3 times a week, other days once a week. All of the dreams felt really real, as in its sometimes that could happen in real time and not the happy ending type of dreams (y'know things like getting back together, him reaching out to me in a romantical way, or marriage). For example:\n\n\\- The first week after i ended things, I dreamt about wanting to reach out to him on whatsapp, or either me looking at his contact details while debating on contacting him again. I felt like i really missed him (i do irl but i didn't want to because i know its not good for me at the moment), but at the end I didn't contact him in my dreams. I dreamt about this multiple times.\n\n\\- Then it progressed to me visiting his hometown (we live in different states), I went to his close friend's cafe and then we met by chance there. He didn't seem like he wanted to talk to me but he stuck around and didn't leave the cafe until my dream finished. Same thing, just me visiting him or him visiting me but we don't talk at all.\n\n\\- Or sometimes even just me dreaming of looking at him, no words spoken but just looking at him.\n\n\\- And last night, i dreamt about playing a game together with him (we are both gamers) and we were talking again but for some reason he was streaming his gameplay on twitch while playing with me? The vibe was okay and he was like before things started going downhill for us.\n\nAny ideas what these dreams mean? I've been in a position where i miss someone and want to come back but this is the first time where i keep on dreaming about someone, not only once but multiple times.

    "body": "I once had a (non lucid) dream which started with me flying a biplane, by myself, from the hangar near my home. I did half of a barrel roll then slipped out of the plane and plummeted to the ground far below, but I did not hit the ground. I suddenly found myself in a small white room with a kids table and chairs, there were some cubbies on the wall and a tall dark entity in the corner. This was many years ago and I don't remember much else.\n\n\nMore recently, only a year or two ago, when I was really into lucid dreaming I dreamt that I woke up from a foreign bed in a stained-wood room. When I was able to detach from my physical body and move freely in the dream I left the room and found a stone hallway that lead to an open area. Directly in front of thw hallway was a large opening that revealed I was in a carved-out cave. To the left there was what felt like a kitchen. To the right there was an open area that was not lit by thw outside light and was very dark. It was epecially dark behind a stone pillar where I felt a presence. The presence stepped into the light and was my grandmother, this is when I fully realized I was in a dream, and the excitement woke me up. Eager to continue the expeince I went back to sleep, but I did not find myself inside the cave with my grandma. This time I was fully lucid inside an office building. I explored a bit and found an opening that met with a yellow lake. There were mountains off to the right. Above to the left there was a bridge-like structure so I spider-man swung up to it. I dipped into the waters and saw that from below/within it was a mucky brown-yellow, unlike the lovely golden surface. I felt like a see monster was gonna get me so I got above the bridge as quick as possible. The waters washed away the control I normally have in a lucid dream but I still remained quite conscious as I landed on the structure and found a large metal clearing with a small black pyramid a hundered or so meters away that had golden markings in a language I do not know. I found myself directly in front of the pyramid and felt the presence of a tall entity behind me (I don't remember seeing them but in my mind they ooked like Anubis). This being wordlessly communicated to me that their world was in danger and the moon was needed to save them, then the clouds dissipated enough for a giant moon to shine it's brilliance on the pyramid and it's golden writings started glowing blue. Then the glowing stopped as the moon was again covered by clouds. Had I remembered that I was dreaming I would've moved the clouds myself (I've done so before, pulling clouds together and darkening them to conjure lightning, I assume I could pull them apart too) so the best thing I could think to do was call on the Greek goddess of the moon, Artemis. When I shouted her name I felt what I could only describe as a ripple across realms. Then I was ripped from that world and into a grey-white limbo where I felt like I was falling in multiple directions while myriad voices were talking angrily but I couldn't hear them, not until one said \"you are the worst of us\" then I woke myself up bc that sh*t was terrifying...\n\nI'd love to hear some interpretations of what these dreams may have meant!"

I see a hole in the floor and lower myself into a stank, wet area and I see him walk by.  \n\n2nd- I'm an apartment decorated all in white.  I see a woman with long super straight blond hair, also dressed in white walking around completely straight face.  No emotion.  She's with another women who looks like that.  They're flirting or interacting bizarrely.  One is lying down and the other is touching her face with her foot (toes).  As I hide behind a pillar/wall, I see they've swapped places and now the other women does the same, but this time the woman instead of caressing her with her foot, she steps on her face.

    "body": "Key word \"loosely\".  It's on the general design of player characters and their general culture that carried over into the dreams.  Everything else was different\n\nThe game these dreams were drawing from is this one.  [Sky: Children of the Light](https://youtu.be/aBQRCHusYyU)\n\nThere were a lot of differences in the dream though.  For example, in the game, while you can swim under water as a secondary mechanic, it's jenky and you have a limited oxygen supply and the main emphasis in the game is on the flying mechanics instead.\n\nIn my dream, it was the opposite.  Yes, I was my in game character, but it was a world where the sky people were largely amphibious.  Even though we could go above land or even fly if they wanted to, we needed to be underwater to truly flourish\n\nI first caught a glimpse of this world in another dream a few nights ago.  I was living in an underwater city with a gamified version of my family.  But I came up to the surface one morning and noticed off in the distance, miles away, what looked to be a beautiful stone mansion on a hillside at the top of a ravine that we were in the middle of\n\nI asked my dad about it and he told me to stay away from that place.  He said that those were invaders who had drained most of the water in the valley which had once been a large river and the we were left with only a fraction of our original territory as a result.\n\nHe warned me never to go near them.  Said they were hostile and hated us.  He said they were scared of us because of our mobility as the only known race who could swim, fly, and run with ease.  They thought we could ambush them at any time and they wouldn't be able to defend themselves\n\nI thought that was ridiculous because we were a pretty peaceful race (look at the game Sky for reference.  It was practically the same thing).  So when nobody was looking I decided I wanted to go talk to them, and took off on the long flight across the ravine\n\nAnd that's where the first dream ended.\n\nOh, and did I mention the \"invaders\" were humans?  That seems pretty important\n\nSo last night's dream seemed to pick up where the first one left off.  Actually, I think I might have even skipped over some stuff because it started inside the mansion with no context for how I got there or how the people living there initially reacted when I showed up\n\nAll I knew was that I shouldn't be there and was desperate to get out\n\nAnd while there were people in the mansion, all dressed in formal wear and drinking martinis, they weren't actively screaming or throwing things at me or anything extreme.  Instead, they all just gave me \"the look\".  You know the one.  That hateful death glare you'd shoot at someone when you're barely tolerating their presence and want them to just leave ; a barely contained rage seething just beneath the surface, threatening to boil over\n\nEventually, I got to what must have been the mansion's front entrance because I saw something that took my breath away\n\nI saw a large dam miles tall and even further in with, and beyond it, an endless expanse of ocean.  I could have just dived into all that water and never looked back; freer than I'd ever been\n\nBut I couldn't\n\nMy family was in the opposite direction.  And if I went out that way, I'd likely never see them again\n\nSo, reluctantly, I had to turn back.  I had to go back through the mansion\n\nLuckily, it had one of those main foyer type of setups where the front and rear exits are essentially connected by a long hallway with rooms branching off.  So it didn't take long to find the exit\n\nI ran out onto the patio dived straight into some water, thinking in the moment that I was home free.  I gulped in lungfuls of water with the same eagerness that you might when coming up for air after swimming.  It was a beautiful place with lots of colorful coral and sunlight refracting onto the bottom\n\nBut that moment was short lived\n\nTurns out it was only a retention pond.  And as I begrudgingly crawled up the rocky shore on the other side, I found, to my dismay, a large brick wall, at least two stories tall, separating the mansion from what lay beyond it.\n\nI would have just flown to the top, but I was too wore out.  My wings didn't work.  So I had to climb up.\n\nIt took ages and it hurt a lot.  But eventually, I made it to the top.  And on the other side, I found that same ravine from the first dream.\n\nThe small lake my family lived in was miles away; nothing but a pitiful creek at the bottom on the way there.  And I couldn't fly anymore.  So I knew I had a long, difficult journey ahead of me\n\nThen I woke up\n\nDISCLAIMER: If this came off as long winded or disjointed.  I'm sorry.  I just woke up and I needed to get this out of my head while it was still fresh\n\nEDIT: Also, I don't know if it matters, but [this is what my game character looks like](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/902562752734842961/1108404748551462973/SKY_20230506_185844_.jpg) and it's more or less how I looked in the dream too"

Before I walked in I turned back to the ladies and asked if they could help me. One of them said \"but you've already begun\". That's when I realized the image of what I could see in the doorway was burned into my eyes. And it only went back to normal if I was looking into that room. So I walked in and my vision was normal again.\n\nThe room was a large horizonal cylinder with computer monitors on each end and along the sides. \n\nThe room also glowed with blue lights. It looked like a mash up of futuristic and spiritual. \n\nThere was something I had to find to get out of the room. Somehow I instinctively knew I had to pick up one of the monitors and move it around. All the information on the screen changed when I moved it. It was identical to one of those 360 pictures where you move your phone to see all around you.\n\nEventually I matched up the monitor with whatever it was I needed to. \n\nThen I went out of the room and I was at a staircase. I had to race someone up the stairs. They were wooden stairs.\n\nI began to run up the stairs and there was a trail of candy all the way up the stairs. I couldn't help but eat the candy as I was running up them. \n\nI finally reached the top and asked the other person why they went a different way but they didn't answer. \n\nI woke up shortly after."

I definitely thought he was cute, and was absolutely floored when I passed by him in the school hallway a couple months later. Throughout middle school I developed a crush that I would like to think was similar to crushing on your favorite celebrity in the sense that I knew there was no way in hell I stood a chance, but I couldn‚Äôt stop admiring him for his personality, smarts, and looks. I was always nervous to not appear stupid if he was around and was actively trying to be quieter when I‚Äôm usually pretty up-beat. \n\nIn high school there were a few classes we had together, and I would always have the feeling he would be glancing at me. I‚Äôd catch him looking away (because of course I would be glancing at him every now and then) and I even did the yawn test just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt overthinking it. He yawned.

After some time, I go inside the barn and I find lots of people who were drinking, doing drugs and partying whilst lights shined around and music played in the background, but that's not what surprised me the most, because there was a pale young lion sitting near 2 wooden poles looking back at me, it didn't seem like it wanted to harm me so I get a bit closer so that I can see it in case it decides to pounce at me while I'm distracted or something.\n\nSome time goes by and people start putting on louder music and start jumping around, this makes the lion uncomfortable, resulting in him standing up and walking away from his spot, but whilst he strides forward, his paw meets with a woman's foot and his claws sink into it, causing her to scream in pain. This makes everyone briefly stop and then start screaming and running around, while makes the lion when more scared, resulting in him biting the people who come close to him defensively. \n\nI don't know what's the meaning of this dream but I'm sure it has something to do with responsibility. I don't wanna sound like one of those annoying people that bug people who smoke or drink but the people at the party were clearly indulging recklessly, something not very responsible, and the lion also was not restrained in any way, he wasn't in a cage or with a leash tying him to those poles, he was completely free and able to do whatever he so desired to do. I think that the lion represent the responsibility (or lack thereof), once the people began to do all kinds of irresponsible things, the lion grew more and more agitated, and when the breaking point happened, he completely lashed out at everyone. \n\nWhat do you guys think this could possibly mean?"

I remember thinking it was odd our landlord didn‚Äôt believe her because clearly there was a bat. It was just such an odd dream, I was curious if anyone has any ideas.

Since a few weeks though I feel better. My depression feels lifted a little, and it's easier to do things (this is not normal or common for me.)\n\nI have noticed that since I'm feeling better mentally, I keep having the same type of nightmares, over and over again, almost each night (that I can remember). I keep dreaming about being held captive or being chased, often the captivity happens inside places that look like our apartment.\n\n\nNow to my question;\n\nHave you ever experienced a heavy increase in nightmares when you felt better in the waking world? And/or do you have any idea why this would be? It doesn't feel like I'm suppressing anything really, and nightmares usually happened once or twice a month, not almost every night like it is now.\n\n\nThank you in advance"

I don‚Äôt really post on Reddit communities of any sort but I‚Äôm getting a little desperate as these dreams are reoccurring and messing with me during the day. \n\nFor the past two weeks I‚Äôve had essentially the same dream over and over again with the same person. Last nights dream was the first time it progressed but they usually just consist of me reuniting with an ex. We are no contact and I had only thought of them occasionally when things remind me of them, but as of late it is a constant. Since the dreams started I‚Äôm in my head thinking that it could be them manifesting a reunion or if it‚Äôs me and I was just wondering if there was a deeper meaning. I don‚Äôt go to sleep with the goal of seeing them, I just want to sleep but they end up there anyways. I also considered it being the environment I was in but I came back home and it‚Äôs still happening. Any help or insight is appreciated! Thank you so very much"

    "body": "Ok first off, I have been taking lions mane at night to invoke dreams, this was one of the most vivid dreams and child like nightmare I‚Äôve had in years, (not lucid either). Also, I realize lions mane causes nightmares I won‚Äôt be taking it at night anymore, but still, I‚Äôve recently read nightmares are the brains way to cope with trauma. So, with that being said I was ok with it happening eventually. \n\nFirst the dream started off as a NSFW dream w/ my girlfriend, there is definitely lead up to the second part, but I don‚Äôt recall, (I absolutely know there was more in between, but absolutely nothing is recalled, up until the nightmare, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve experienced that before).\n\nNow, I was with my boys and girl, we called into a haunted house to go visit it, we set reservations. When we got there, nobody took are tickets at the door, it was just open and nobody there. We went in and we were giggling and thought it was funny and waiting for a jump scare, although, nothing was happening so we got confused and a little creeped out. It was a dark, cold and empty house. \n\nWe decided to go upstairs, I walked into the bathroom and before I even got in I saw a extremely tall, skinny, lengthy man who looked like he hadn‚Äôt eaten in years. All I remember seeing was his foot which was extremely bruised, but somehow I know exactly what he looked liked without even looking at his whole body. Weird I know.  \n\nHis face looked like the rake, but I didn‚Äôt see it visually I just knew, it‚Äôs confusing, but yeah. I slammed the door shut and freaked the f*** out I told everyone and we realized we probably should get the hell out and this wasn‚Äôt what we thought. We ran to the door and everything closed, everything. Windows locked, doors locked, everything immediately as we attempted to escape. \n\nWe then heard the man climbing around in the ceiling like an extremely loud spider. My buddy Jeff decided to get out on the outside patio which wasn‚Äôt unlocked, although somehow we all knew we weren‚Äôt allowed to leave, but he tried anyway. When outside the patio it was gated and he jumped off which was literally a small 3 foot drop maximum, and he immediately broke apart, legs amputated, arms still intact to his torso blood everywhere. \n\nWhat really bothered me was he was still alive and was attempting to scoop his organs and intestines back into his stomach and get his legs back. He was screaming and yelling help me! \n\nWe called the cops, (not when we were locked in a house with spider-demon-man, but when are friend fucking exploded into a million pieces, I know, I guess horror movies and dreams follow the same rule, being dumb). \n\nThey came and he was asking them for help cause he was still alive and they just threw him to the side where there was another mysterious dead body. Then I woke up with the worst derealization and anxiety, but yeah, anybody think there is any meaning? \n\nMy home life hasn‚Äôt been the best lately and I‚Äôve been going through a lot of stress, also sorry for the long ass wall of text, this just helped me to journal it, thanks for reading!"

Shortly afterwards, one of my friends from middle school came and sat next to me and said he was mad at me for being dramatic, this actually happened in real life too when I was that age and I guess it really hurt my friend anyways, so then I was suddenly adult me and I said I‚Äôm sorry I acted that way towards you, what can I do to fix it?

    "body": "My dream starts with me gardening vegetables and fruit at my moms house where i used to live. There's this cardboard box I have with an asparagus shoot flowering in some soil. I put clothes in it for some unknown reason, but I remember they were clean clothes and not dirty clothes. I beat myself up about it and my step-dad says it's okay. Its during the time my mom serves dinner, and there's only enough food left for me and none left for my step-dad. I tell him 'here you can have the rest'. He says thank you and I choose to go without. It's a warm feeling.\nWell, cut to a scene the next morning, I notice shoots of asparagus growing out of my back! Three of them, and they're all flowering like the same one I was growing. I started freaking out and asked my Unphased parents if I should remove them myself. My mom said No because they would leave big open wounds that would get infected. I said You're Right. I begged my mom to take me to the hospital so I can get them removed. She ended up taking me, and they suggested taking me to a Special Hospital as this was a Special Case that doesn't happen everyday.\nI go up the stairs and my mom guides me to walk to the door in front of me. I walk through, and she immediately closes the door behind me. I try to open it but it won't open, I try to bang on it to have someone open it from the other side, no luck. \nI was scared and panicky. Inside was a waiting room with alot of windows with sun and plenty of chairs. There were two guys about my age (I'm going to be 23 here in a few days) who were sitting together in the corner not saying anything. They just looked at me as I sat there and made me feel uncomfortable. They got up and sat closer to me. They looked mentally unstable. I got up and moved away from them, playing musical chairs. Then they got up and moved closer to me again. At this time I told them I didn't feel comfortable and I'd just like to sit alone please. They didn't answer and I got up and decided to walk around to see if they followed. They followed me and looked like they were going to hurt me. I walked fast and noticed  the back office where a bunch of women were working with medications and documents and computers, and went into their area saying these 2 were going to hurt me. They didn't seem to care, and one of the guys ended up tackling me down, cutting my airway to breathe. I kept trying to scream saying I can't breathe I can't breathe, I'm going to die, I'm dead. One of the ladies there nonchalantly helped him off me and told them not to do it again. I was questioning why they didn't take it more seriously. The guys left me alone but were close by. I walked within the back office to try to be safe if anything happened. The 2 guys ccame in again and I was walking away from them as they followed me . They kept following me and I asked the ladies if this was normal and why they weren't doing anything. I then find another patient in the back office like me who kind of signals he's been going through the same thing but it is what it is. They medicate him and he just has to deal with it. \nI confront the girls and ask why they don't help the issue. One of the boss ladies insinuates that the two guys' family owns the hospital and they are being paid to let them do whatever they want. I spoke out against it and said it wasn't right and how your letting them control how you do your job and knowingly hurting people instead of helping. \nIt was then one girl came up behind me and syringed my foot with some sort of tranquilizer thing and I faded out.\nI woke up there in the same spot again and went in and said the same thing. How they are knowingly hurting people under their control. As I said it the second time,  I can see 2 or 3 girls side with me. However the bosses didn't like that and they said they weren't going to listen to me anymore and basically to syringe me again. One of the girls who was siding with me got the syringe but gave me a look and was reluctant. I said I don't need this to get better, I just need these plants out of my back so I can go home.\nThen I woke up. \n\nIn real life, I've just taken up gardening for the first time and am obsessed with growing my plants. Also, I just had asparagus for dinner last night but I don't live at my parents house. I've actually been living with Mt fiance in our own apartment for the last 2 years. Also, I am taking prescription drugs right now for depression and anxiety, but I've always felt they were a dead end and weren't fixing a problem. I felt that they couldn't fix my mood swings problem and that I actually have to work on that myself- no medication could fix it. \n\nSo please share with me what you think this dream is trying to tell me, thank you :)"

I had my dog with me. The house was exactly as I remember it when I was a kid. I was walking into the living room at near dark, there was a man walking up the long gravel road to the back door. He wasn't and still isn't familiar in anyway. I remember he knocked on the door then rang the doorbell while I hid. It felt instinctual that I hide. My dog was barking and I became worried that the man would think the house was empty, and open to being robbed. So, I went to the door and cracked it. I made up a lie, \"my dad and brother's are just upstairs, cleaning their guns.\" But he had this wide grin as I said goodbye and shut the door. I think he was looking for directions he said.

I sat on the day bed there and it immediately felt disgusting. I peeled back the cushion and there was hands and feet stacked up on top of each othe, like the couch was filled with bodies. I stayed calm and subtly showed him and asked to leave. He looked concerned but stayed cool, we left in this car. As we were driving I asked him about our hometown and he said he‚Äôs never been. I asked if he‚Äôd like to go and he said he shouldn‚Äôt because his family is in the other direction. I was about to ask him what his dream car would be, because in real life he has it, but then I woke up."

I didn‚Äôt see or feel anything. Then, the stars start to appear around me and I realize I‚Äôm in space.\nI could see only the earth and the stars me. Everything else was pitch black.

    "body": "I should start off by saying I am experiencing cannabis withdrawals, which is known to trigger more vivid and surreal dreams. \n\nLast night I had a dream that I befriended a disabled race car driver. His disabilities were from birth rather than an accident, but were incredibly severe and horrific. His legs were twisted and bent behind his back, and he had a pair of dead eyes which protruded from the top of his head. He also had prosthetic eyes where his real eyes should have been. At first he seemed pleasant, and I believe I worked in the garage that maintained his race car. At some point in the dream, we were both attending a party. Somehow, my friend had morphed into an even more deformed female , and was arguing with another woman at the party. All of a sudden, the disfigured woman began horrifically murdering the other woman. Tearing her breasts off, just an absolutely horrific scene. I fled from the party, found myself at the bottom of a grassy hill where I found my real life wife. We saw the disabled person at the top of the hill. They were now even larger, even more disfigured and resembled more of a monster than a person, yet in my mind I knew it was the same person all along. Me and my wife make a run for it and the dream ends. \n\nI remembered the dream when I woke, but it didn‚Äôt disturb me too much. It was only later in the day thinking about the dream that it‚Äôs really starting to bother me.  \n\nAfter typing this out I have come up with my own interpretation: \n\nThe disabled person is my addiction to cannabis. He is disabled because my addiction limits me almost like a disability. As he becomes more deformed, it is my addiction spiraling out of control. The woman he murders at the party is an element of my healthy psyche, which has been harmed by my cannabis use. I flee from the killer just like I have decided to leave cannabis behind. The disabled person becomes increasingly horrific and harmful just like my cannabis use was once a minor issue has spiraled into a potential catastrophe for my personal life. I found and fled with my wife because she really did save me from my addiction.\n\nWhilst I realize many people can have a casual relationship with cannabis, I have been a daily user from a young age which has undoubtably become a harmful addiction."

    "body": "Recently I've had a couple weird end of the world dreams, that I saw pretty close to each other. Just the concept of what was happening in them was so bizarre that I wrote down they key points as soon as woke up so that I don't forget them. They messed with my brain pretty hard. This is the first one I saw a few weeks ago.\n\nIt starts with me standing near a house. It appears that according to the situation I am in the dream - this is a house I grew up in, even though it is completely untrue in reality. There is a woman with me, my age, that appears to be my sister (not really, I don't have a sister). It is dusk, the sun is disappearing behind the horizon and the sky is red. The house is located close to a highway that climbs a rather steep hill. Everywhere I look in the yard (it looks kinda overgrown and abandoned, like it hasn't been taken care of for a while) I recall some chunks of memories of being a kid and growing up, playing there (which are obviously not real, I grew up living in an apartment).\n\nI walk towards the hill together with the woman. She is telling me something that I don't remember any more. I remember getting a very strong feeling of nostalgia and at the same time a feeling of great sadness because this is the last time I am going to see this place and the person next to me. We reach the top of the hill and I look down on the road and the forest below me. I don't know what makes me feel this - I have never seen that place or that woman in my life. And the feeling is very strong. I can't say I experienced anything like that for any place or person in the real life.\n\nThen the setting suddenly changes - I am standing in a park in the middle of the day. There are people around me, who are panicking. And I suddenly remember that there is something terrifying that appeared in the sky recently. Apparently, there is a new moon in the sky now. It is called Solomon's Shadow (I don't know where the name came from, in the dream I just know that this is what the moon is called). And it is an organic! moon. Meaning it is basically a huge living organism (but not conscious, it is basically like a plant or a primitive organism, or something like that). Sometimes it emits a ray of black light (literally a black beam) that destroys anything it covers (buildings, people the ground itself). It does this at random so basically there is no safe place on the planet where it can't reach. Whether or not you die is a lottery, there is no point in hiding. And the consensus is that there is no way to get rid of it and that it is going to destroy the Earth eventually. \n\nI look up at the sky and see this new moon. It looks like a dark pink blob of organic matter. It is around the same size as the sun appears in the sky. As I look at it, it emits the black beam somewhere not far from me and I hear people screaming. Then some female voice near me is saying \"It is growing. Will you go inside?\".  As I look it makes me feel a weird feeling of... awe, I guess? After a few moments I suddenly get pulled directly towards the moon and sucked inside of it. The same female voice says \"New module is growing. Module 1 - the flower\". When I appear inside the moon it looks like a pinkish sphere with rapidly growing plants and flowers inside of it. There are huge flat platforms randomly appearing in midair, made up of winding greenery. The space inside of it is huge, absolutely immense. I get suspended in the air for a few moments and then start freefalling. At which point I wake up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what to make of it. It just felt weird. Such a strange mixture of emotions - feeling so sad and nostalgic like I never felt before about the place I am seeing for the first time, and the whole experience of the new moon."

It‚Äôs always known to be haunted. The house looks different every time. One dream, every time I got to the stairs to lead to the attic, it felt scary but I knew I needed to go up. Last night, I saw the ghost and could communicate with it. I got close with the owner due to this and the ghost attempted to lead me to the attic.

    "body": "!! TW GORE !!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I've been having these really weird nightmares. I don't remember my dreams often but recently I've been remembering dreams that caused me a lot of distress. Ive been watching war documentaries/horror genre recently. I haven't felt scared or uncomfortable while watching this stuff, more like intrigued. But when I have dreams about this stuff it feels traumatic in the moment.\n\nDream #1\n\nLet me start off by saying when I had this dream, I was super sick and had a really high fever. I felt genuinely so awful I convinced myself I had to go to the hospital. But instead my mom slept in my room with me and helped me throughout the night. \n\nI really don't remember much of this dream, or if it was more of a hallucination. But I had convinced myself the Chinese Government was hunting me down and wanting to preform experimental heart surgeries on me. They had these six different mechanical contraptions they would place inside my heart. They would then see which one worked best. This meant six different surgeries, if I didn't die. I remember waking up sobbing to my mom in the middle of the night about how they were after me and trying to kill me. She would reassure me that I was okay and needed to go back to sleep. My head was throbbing though and my heart felt physically hurt, even though no damage was done. I was in and out of sleep for hours, either waking up in terror about how they were hunting me down, or waking up to throw up. \n\nGenuinely one of the worst nights I've ever had. \n\nDream #2\n\nThis one happened maybe two nights after the first one mentioned (Just last night.) This one was very similar, except I stayed asleep for the whole dream and didn't wake up sobbing and delusional.\n\nIn this one, I had to get my four wisdom teeth removed. (I have it planned I have to get mine actually removed within the next year or so.) In this dream, I was in a dimly lit office, I wasn't nervous for the procedure, except for maybe the pain afterwards. I was aware of how this was going to work, so I was confident in it. I was put on one of those metal surgery tables, they drugged me up, and I was out. They removed the four teeth just fine, and I felt nothing. However, near the end of the procedure the anesthesia wore off and I was awake again. For some reason for the procedure they had to slit my wrists and let me bleed out. I was aware of this since the beginning, but for some reason the doctor couldn't do it, which meant I had to preform this myself. I grabbed a knife on the tray next to my table, and created several deep slits all over my forearm. I remember this being excruciatingly painful, as this was supposed to be done by the surgeon while I was unconscious. I had to lower my forearm to let the blood drip down my arm, and let me tell you, there was a lot of it. After the surgery, I remember questioning if they had really taken my teeth out, which my mom reached into my mouth and pressed down where they had previously been. \"Feel that? that means they're gone!\" I also had several scars all along my forearm.\n\nThat's all I remember from this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing to mention is there were no faces for any of the surgeons. I don't have any trauma from surgery or any medical procedures, although it does make me a little weary. Nothing too bad ever, just a little nervous. \n\nI'm really curious as to what you guys think these could mean."

Don't exactly remember what he was telling me but we passed this wall with terrarium inserts with blue glowing items. I made a remark on their beauty and he told me how important the color blue was. I entered the elevator while he stood in front and stayed outside the elevator and there was a lady inside the elevator waiting. I wanted to press a button but then she quickly pressed it before I could, although I didn't even know where I was headed. \n\nSuddenly the elevator shot upwards crazy fast and it made me scared af, holding onto the sides. When it reached the top, the elevator started swinging back and forth like a seesaw, as if it wasn't balanced. The doors opened and there was a platform hanging in front of it held by ropes from the ceiling. I screamed at the lady that we had to move quickly or we would die. I was terrified but jumped, barely making it to the platform and she was screaming in fear. I tried to coax her towards me but the ropes of the platform started to wear down so I had to move fast. I went ahead without looking back at her and making it across the platform to safe steady floor thinking I'd have to save myself first, hoping she'd make it too. I thought she died but then she was next to me, giving me some relief. \n\nWe went through glass doors and entered a regular corporate floor as if the scene before never happened. People were walking around working. Nobody looked as if it was strange. It was really high up too. I saw a stairwell leading down which I followed where I found two doors as if it was a movie theater, went inside but it was empty. When I backed out I found more stairs spiraling down, they got really tight at one point as if nobody was meant to walk them and nobody seemed to notice them either. \n\nThen I randomly ran into my best friend, who was happy and told me everything was fine, nothing to worry about and he was happily at work. He lead me through a hallway and offices. They reminded me of a mix between high school and uni, vague places I've been before. I saw people at desks working whom I recognized to be the people from my friend his internship, a theater production company - I know their faces because I worked with them a couple years back when I did catering for one of their plays 4 nights a week for 2 months. They didn't notice me and I didn't want to bother them with their work so I walked further. My friend said he had to get back to work so I went on ahead by myself. \n\nThen suddenly I noticed all this time the lady had been following me. I recalled her mentioning things like a vague voice in the background but it didn't click until I actually saw her next to me. I don't know what she said exactly though. Went down more stairs and eventually I got back on the ground floor as if nothing had happened. I went outside, the sun was shining and then it ended."

I was supposed to whack it with a stick, but every time it charged me I was never able to fully extend the range of my attack to deliver a killing blow. I only managed to half ass some weak strikes on its head. Fear and compassion got in the eay of me using my full strength on it. However this ultimately was still enough.

I can‚Äôt bring myself to tell her about it, but I have a terrible feeling whenever I‚Äôm at her house since then. The worst part is when I woke up my arm felt like it had been pulled on."

    "body": "I had a dream, well night mare last night that I was kidnapped and held hostage. In this dream I couldn't tell you who kidnapped me, I just knew it was male and female couple. But in this dream I was kidnapped and there was another girl there.  Only she was about 10/12yrs old, short dirty blonde hair with at home highlights. Was about 4' 7\" and roughly 90lbs. Very obviously not well cared for. Very dirty. I was my current age of 23. But we were out in the woods in a trailer home with a basement. We got a lot of packages, like Amazon type stuff and for whatever reason, I was allowed to sign for them. And one of the times that I went to sign for a package, it had my signature already. Obviously confused I looked at the mailman and she told me to sign next to it. So I did and it was identical. She asked if I was *my name* and I said yes. She told me to go with her and I refused at first cause of the little girl and I needed to save her. Well she forced me away and took me a hospital where I saw my mom and daughter again. I said I had to go back and save the girl. The police said they would work with me and help get her out safely. Now I'm not sure why we couldn't save her when I was saved. But we went back I saw her again and tried to get her and our captors came back and trapped us again in the dark.. I woke up at that pointbut now that im awake i described how she looked to my partner, I realize that younger girl, was me. Everything was identical to how I looked at that age. I'm not sure what that means, nothing I've searched helps or mentions younger self.. I'm very spiritual with angels. So I'm curious if there's something I'm supposed to understand about this dream, if so, what? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you."

I would love to hear your interpretations of the dream, even if you only have an idea of what some parts could mean.\n\nHere it is:\nI was in my classroom and my classmates were passing around a venemous snake for everyone to look at. They said we had to choke the snakes head to not get bitten. If you licked the head of the snake it would be very hot, this proved how venemous it was. I felt bad for the snake because it was about to die since everyone chocked it,  so i let it go. Then it bit my classmate and he died. But i didnt think about that because i was focused on catching a little mouse that i saw running around on the floor. But then the mouse got bit by the snake, and the mouse bit me. I got dizzy and it felt so real, i could really feel how sick i got and how i was completely out of it. I thought i was gonna die so i called 911 and they told me they couldnt help and i could call back after the weekend,so I got mad and clicked them. \n\nThen the dream kind of shifts. I was in a abandoned part of my school. It was a stairwell with a big grid you could climb up to the garret and the roof with. Now i was gonna go up to the garret with my friend and some unknown girl, and also a very tall man (about 2m). His skin was grey and he had black eyes, and also like knots all over his body. The only thing he wore was shorts. I dont remember me being afraid of him tho. Then we all climbed up. I saw this wall with names all over. At first i didnt get what it was but then i saw my aftername and 2021 written after.  I knew that was my uncle that died in 2021. So the wall had names written with everyone that died or was going to die. Then i saw my last name again but with a question mark after. I thought it meant i was about to die. Then i turned around to look at another wall. There was 4 names and they were all my exes. Suddenly they just disappeared, like they had never been there in the first place. Then the tall man told me im going to die now, and for some reason he pulled out the head of the snake. I looked at my phone to see what time i was going to die,and then i woke up."

When I got to school, the dream just skipped to the near end of the school day when I had my 5th period and I was walking to class and in the dream my school was a 6 story buildings (irl it's actually 3 stories)with classrooms and because I was so tired, I was walking to my class that was on the 3rd floor but I just didn't stop walking and I went to the tallest floor and found a door. also the tallest floor was where the least classes happened so there were barely any people. I went through a door and it was kinda like that scene in Deltarune where I walk through the door and the door just disappears behind me and I'm just in a room with a single desk in the middle of it, then some kid who looked like a year 7 walked in from somewhere and just started doing his own stuff in a work book. In the room I was in, there were 0 doors or windows and I was just so confused. then an older man who looked very similar to my old Japanese teacher, walked in and didn't question why I was there. I started panicking a lot because I had to get to my class so I asked the man if there was a way to get to S11 (that was where my class was) and he said that he could teach me a teleporting spell to get there so then he got some paper and drew some lines that overlapped each other to look like a circle, then he got some glass with a small circle panel of glass in the middle (that glass had a different and more clear texture) he told me to write where I wanted to go underneath the circle on the paper and look through the clear part of the glass and align the clear circle with the one on the paper in my line of sight. then some green aura shit happened and instantly went away and he was like \"oopsy daisy it didn't work haha\" so I tried again and it DIDN'T WORK so I started panicking again because my teacher was probably going to yell at me because I had missed about 20 minutes of the class by now. and the man was like \"let's practice taikwondo!\" and the boy at the table and him started practising taikwondo while I was trying to do the spell over and over but it never worked.

    "body": "I just woke up from this dream:-\n\nSo me and a couple of friends were doing a course for a certificate, which was meant to teach people skils. It was probably day 1 and the new professor came in and said that to see our people skills, he needed to test us like in an interview. He asked all of us to assemble in another room that was a lot far away.\n\nSo we all went there. And we were required to remove our shoes. We were waiting for the professor to arrive. It turned out that the professor didn't come and we decided to leave for our home instead. While doing so, I realised that I was in the 2nd floor. So I was finding the downstairs. I met more of my friends whom I had not caught up with for a long time.\n\nI saw some sorcerrors casting spells and reciting rituals and ran away from them. Then I saw a disabled person harassing, probably sexually assaulting women in public to get some money for himself. I ran away from there too.\n\nI had finally found the downstairs and I got away with a friend. After walking a few steps, I realised I didn't have my shoes on. So I had to go in again. I managed to find my shoes but I had again lost the stairs. I got into a floor which had a lot of halls. I ran into a few of them to find the stairs. But there weren't. A guy stared at me. And I asked that am I in the second floor? And he said, no you're in the 3rd floor. I found a few workers and I was just about to ask them until someone called me and asked, \"Aren't you the writer of these books?\" (There was a bookstall nearby) and I said, \"You might have mistaken me for someone else. I'm sorry I'm not\" and then, he asked me to find a book. I did, and I left to ask the workers.\n\nThe workers showed me a lift. But they had to give access for the lift to work. They gave me the access to go, but when the lift opened, it was a small space shuttle. I somehow managed to fit inside. Magically, I was in the ground floor again. But my height had shrunk from 2.571 to 2.071 (don't remember the measurements units) (I'm probably 5'11 or 6 IRL) I found my friend and we left."

    "body": "In my dreams that is. I have frequent dreams that I can either fly or breathe under water. But I have to develop the ability throughout the dream. It starts with jumping a little higher, floating back to the ground, then I can levitate, and then fly (and then higher/for longer)\n\nWith the breathing under water it starts with breath holding, and then I take tiny little breaths and holding those. And then I just end up being able to breathe like normal. I‚Äôll just spend the dream at the bottom of a pool (or other body of water). Kinda floating, near the bottom. \n\nAnd in both types of dreams I can FEEL that I‚Äôm flying- or levitating/floating (both in the air and under the water)\n\nThey just happen so often and I wonder if there‚Äôs any meaning behind those things. And how can I make it happen more? With the flying ones, the jumping/levitating I start doing without trying. It‚Äôs just like ‚Äòoh, I‚Äôm jumping‚Äô, and then I realize I can fly and I ‚Äòactively fly‚Äô, I realize I‚Äôm dreaming eventually. But I can‚Äôt control anything other than the flying part. Can‚Äôt control the setting or circumstances, can‚Äôt control other actions, it‚Äôs just transportation, basically. Sometimes I stop and fly so much the rest of the dream falls away and I‚Äôll just be flying over random things. Like the pyramids, once. By flying I mean it‚Äôs just me going through the air. No wings or flying vehicles. I just jump off the ground and off I go.\n\nAnd with the underwater breathing I can‚Äôt control if someone got in the water too, so I wouldn‚Äôt call it lucid. \n\nAnd even when I realize I‚Äôm dreaming, I can‚Äôt change anything or control anything (beyond ‚Äòoh, I‚Äôm distractedly flying), I can‚Äôt wake up from them. I‚Äôll be trapped in nightmares and know I‚Äôm dreaming, but I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôve even died in my dreams and it‚Äôll be like I was dead but ‚Äòwoke up‚Äô in the dream and went about the rest of the dream (as it would have played out, like I said, I have zero input or control)\n\nI guess worth mentioning is that I have SEVERE insomnia, I‚Äôm heavily medicated for it so dreams can be more intense. I also am on other meds that disrupt certain process, and those effect nightmares and those- there are just quite dark things in my head‚Ä¶so I understand this may be quite a wall to scale to interpret my dreams since they‚Äôre subject to quite a few variables. I‚Äôll repeated the questions I had, so it‚Äôs more concise:\n\nWhat could dreams about flying mean? I try to bring it on but it doesn‚Äôt always work. Or work properly. And I mean, I‚Äôm happy with these parts. I tried really hard to take control over my dreams, but that‚Äôs not a thing I can do. I can just fly away when I‚Äôve built up the flight skill. \n\nWill it ever, or can I trigger the process of ‚Äòlearning‚Äô to fly?\n\nWhat could the dreams where I spend my time just floating down below the water mean? I really enjoy the water dreams too. I‚Äôm comfortable (which is extra because I‚Äôm chronic pain patient. Pain wakes me up‚Ä¶except for the dreams I get stuck in. My brains decided it has a dream queued, and that I‚Äôll be following the script until the story has been acted out.)\n\nI also get nightmares so severe that I usually can‚Äôt wake up from, or it‚Äôll be one of those where my sense are obscured. Like the sun is always in my eyes. I can‚Äôt see anything and I just try to shield my yes with the shade in creates. Or here‚Äôs one I absolutely hate- I‚Äôll need to go somewhere. Like what if I escaped from some insane kller monster and I‚Äôm try to run and OH SHIT, I don‚Äôt have shoes. The bads either took them or they took me when I was barefoot. Effective anti-escape method for me lol. My brain tries to outsmart itself. I also feel pain in dreams, I‚Äôd I‚Äôve woken with injuries. None are serious. But there is nothing around that could explain it. \n\nSorry this became so long, lol. \n\nThis post was meant to ask what dreams of flying (and flying is a skill I have to level lol) could mean anything and why can‚Äôt do  right away\n\nSame question applies to the floating below water. \n\nAnd- how can i grab immediate control of my dream\n\nAlso the nightmare aspect- the being taken and held til they‚Äôre done (and yeah those words were a thing lol, that I couldn‚Äôt leave until I‚Äôd rescued people. It was intense\n\nIf you read this all, I thank you \n\nI know it‚Äôs a lot to ask, but the meaning behind flying and floating under water? I‚Äôd love to hear some interactions \n\nJust. If you have a minute. Thanks in advance and sleep well üò¥ I appreciate you‚Äôve taken the time to consider and that means a lot. \n\nSweet dreams, fellow travelers"

This is something that really bothers me alot. My mom urges me to get a new one but I don't feel like it, obviously.\n\nLast night in my dream, I saw my pet bird. Bear in mind he never got the chance to get hand tamed or anything- but in the dream he was flying around me and kept staying attached to my hand or arm, or sat near me and would come when I called him.\nDuring this time as I was wandering my dream with my bird, he randomly kept disappearing and would leave a few feathers floating around me. This kept happening till eventually he didn't come back and I just had a bunch of feathers around me. \nI then called out his name and looked for him, but he didn't come back and I just woke up.\n\nIt was really sad, made me miss him more than I already do.\nAny idea what this means?"

I'm 31f INFP. \n\nI was at a wharf and I was fishing with a man trying to catch fish to sell. I put my foot in the water and a tiny little fish burrowed it's way under my skin, it didn't hurt and I was not scared, it started swimming under my skin on my foot. I cut a little hole and squeezed it out and it flipped onto the wharf. It looked like a regular ocean fish, nothing special, grey in colour with a pink stripe. It was the size of a grain of rice. I asked the man what it would be worth and he said it was super rare and worth thousands. I asked if the fish might be my grandma who died as I felt she was watching me and he said yes, and then pointed to a pray mantis that was sitting on a flower that was visible through a whole in the wharf, and he said \"see there's your grandad sitting watching her\". The little fish flopped and propelled it's self back into the ocean and swam away. \n\nWe started to leave when I saw a big shiny beautiful fish. It was pink and orange iridescent and was 10 feet long, it looked like an eel but had the face of a koi fish. I asked the man what that one was and he told me they called them coyotes. I asked what they were worth as surely a fish so beautiful would get lots of money. He just laughed and said \"they're beautiful, but they're everywhere, we would get $10 at most, there's no point chasing that\" and then we left the wharf empty handed, but I felt ok. \n\nI have no idea what this means. And I've tried to search online about meaning of different aspects but nothing resonates, but I can not for the life of me shake this dream, it brings me this weird calmness in a very stressful time in my life."

    "body": "The only other dreams i have that match up to being as realistic and vivid as this one was are recurring PTSD dreams, so i am compelled to treat it with importance and meaning. \nThe dream starts with me walking up to a huge building with a tall man at the entrance as he asks me, \"are you here for auditions?\" To which i nod and reply \"Yes\", and he leads me in. There are hundreds of people throughout the building color-coded by which floor they belong to, which the man explains is being organized by talents. He hands me a blue sweat suit, saying \"i think you're perfect for this floor, we're going to push you in particular to your limits.\" I took this as a shining compliment and motivation, not a scary intimidation. I don't remember what my particular talent was, but there was no audience, just tons of other performers being watched alongside me by the organizers. I remember it being a similar feeling to soccer try-outs I experienced as a kid/teenager, so i do know i was pushing myself, and that this was something i wanted so bad. When i finally got excused for a bathroom break, i was dripping in sweat and could barely walk- i was limping, even. As i was making my way to the blue floor's bathrooms, i saw they were all occupied, with other contenders sitting in a line for them. I realized this bathroom break was the only general break we had, and a limited time for it, so i decided heading to the bathroom on the red floor, which was a treacherous journey concerning my physical state. My body felt so painfully heavy. This was when the same man from the beginning rushed up to me announcing something along the lines of \"This is what we're looking for here- look at how hard she's worked!\" Which i say \"no, don't look at me. I'm dripping in sweat and exhausted.\" \nWhen i finally get to the vacant restrooms, my whole body felt as though it had been beaten up as i sit on the toilet. I couldn't even relieve myself/pee, i was just trying to rest. I heard others in the neighboring stalls crying, and conversations of some being found passed out in their stalls. For some reason, this motivated me even more to not burn out. As i was heading out of the bathroom to pick back up on my audition, i asked someone, \"what is all of this even for?\" To which he replied \"the circus, of course!\" \nI woke up expecting to be dripping in sweat, or needing to go to the restroom, but neither were true. I would usually assume these things are just signs of having a bad sleep, but i was physically well-rested. I would appreciate it so much if anyone knew what such a dream could symbolize."

Then our spirits are in some clouds and it‚Äôs starting to spiral and I remember feeling calm and knowing it was going to be ok we were just going to die. So it‚Äôs like a downward spiral of clouds that our spirits are twisting in and we come out as ourselves with angel wings. I intuitively figured out if they were going to try to bring us back to life we‚Äôd have to go down into our bodies. I remember them trying to bring me back to life and I intuitively knew I had to try to take a breath from my body even though I wasn‚Äôt in it. When I tried I came back into my body.

There was an old man sitting in front of his house, and a young boy, around 14 years old, seemed to take a liking to me. I, however, didn't pay much attention and went inside the house.\n\nInside, the house was already clean. My family decided to go somewhere to swim, but I chose to stay in the house and take a bath. They left, and I was the only person in the house. Suddenly, I heard someone, perhaps an older man, kidnapping my large floating fish that was suspended in the air (I'm not sure why I had such a fish). I decided to take a look but then suddenly blacked out.\n\nWhen I woke up, it was morning as if nothing had happened. I woke up in my bed and noticed that my body seemed to have matured. I didn't dwell on it and proceeded to go to the living room where my youngest sister, mom, and second-to-last younger sister were eating.\n\nThen, my mom handed me a huge folded picture and said, \"It just arrived.\" I opened it and was confused to see a class picture. Our school doesn't normally do that. When I checked the lower part of the picture, it indicated that it was a grade 12 picture, even though I remember being only a grade 11 student.\n\nI asked my mom about this, and she laughed and said I was crazy or making up a story. I asked her about various things like how our research at school went or how my 18th birthday was, but for some reason, when I returned to reality, I forgot about those details. It felt like they were significant in the dream but got filtered out upon waking.\n\nMy youngest sister also seemed to have matured physically, and my second-to-last younger sister, who liked going out, was already working, which confused me because my mom said she was already 18 and it was fine. I asked my mom, \"Then how old am I now?\" She replied, \"You're 19, turning 20,\" even though my 2nd to the last younger sister, who was said to be a working student, has a significant age gap of around 3 to 4 years with me.\n\n\nI went to school and noticed many changes, especially in my school uniform and the people around me. I was unsure whether I was still in grade 12 or already in college. I suddenly realized that I had lost one and a half years of my memory.\n\nAs I walked around, I encountered a few familiar faces and then some classmates who were also my classmates in reality. They appeared more mature, and I asked them to accompany me because I had many questions. We were probably less than 10, and there were still a few unfamiliar faces who were new friends of my ex-classmates.\n\nI explained to them that I had woken up and couldn't remember what happened after I fell asleep while we were still working on our research. For some reason, one of my male group mates mentioned that our defense didn't go well, which confused me. I felt like it failed because I hadn't been able to attend the defense. I told them the whole story but it seems they did not believe me.\n\nI asked many questions, but just like what happened with my mom, the answers seemed filtered. I could see them talking, but the sound was muted.\n\nI checked my conversation with my classmates/friends on my phone and noticed that the way I replied to them was very different from my usual responses to many people. It felt as though someone had been using my body for a year.\n\nWhile I was wandering around trying to find my way to school, a moment of consciousness came to me, and I realized I was on a long, high, or upper round structure that was collapsing, with many people still on it. I was confused about what was happening but luckily, I managed to escape before the structure completely collapsed.\n\nIn my dream, I was able to dream within my dream, which made it confusing. It felt like the dreams of my dream self and my actual self had merged, making me confused.\n\n\n\n------\nCan u tell me what does it mean?

We are at this really nice house, but idk why or how we were allowed to stay there. The surrounding area is infested with huge grizzley bears with their cubs. I noticed as we're going about our day that NO ONE will close any of the exterior doors or lock them up. I start to get really heated and yell at everyone to lock up the doors so the bears don't get in. My dad gaslights me and say \"you're overreacting, it's fine!\" My Husband and my Brother agree with him, and my husband tries to calm me down, but I just get more heated.\n\nWell, eventually the inevitable happens and the bears start to come in. They are aggressive and angry and try to kill us. I have to sneak around locking doors so more don't come in, but when I do, one of my family members leaves or enters and inevitably leaves the door wide open. Eventually, my brother leave and comes back with groceries and he's parked far away from the house. I get mad and ask why he thought it would be a good idea to park so far away from the house with bears closing in! It's not safe! Why didn't he just back up close to the porch? He looks at me like I'm stupid and says \"Well that's where you're suppose to park.\" \n\nWhile I'm helping unload groceries, a mom and her cubs gets between me and the house and I have to figure out a way to get around her so she doesn't see me as a threat to her or her cubs. I have do dive into bushes and really sneak around. When I get back in the house, all the doors are wide open again and the bears are everywhere.\n\nIt finally gets bad enough that my Dad grabs his rifle and I grab mine and we have to shoot them to keep them away. My gun kept jamming though, so I was getting really frustrated. Finally, I get it to work, but I can't hold it properly for some reason. Like, I'm not coordinated enough to hold it (which is ridiculous because it's my irl rifle and I shoot it just fine irl). \n\nFinally I can get a shot out and it only maimes one of the bears. This makes sense, because my rifle irl is not strong enough to take out a bear, but I was desperate and they were trying to kill us. The poor bear whines and is all pitiful. It's laying on the ground and really injured. It breaks my heart, so I try to go for the kill shot to put it out if it's misery and my gun jams again. I almost had an aneurysm. My dad had to give it the kill shot.\n\nEventually I wake up and I'm really heated. It's not the first time I've had a dream where I try to warn my family about danger and they ignore me or downplay the situation. Hell, I've had similar dreams about my co-workers not listening to my warnings or doing anything during a crisis. \nWhat does it mean???"

I proceed to talk to her and ask her for directions. She tells me she wants to show me, grabs my hands, and pulls me in the hut. Inside of the hut is beautifully decorated and it‚Äôs surprisingly spacious. She pulls me onto her bed and gets very close. She stares deep into my eyes and then transforms into a female wolf. \nThe wolf is white with piercing eyes; a very beautiful creature. We then begin to have sex and she shows me where to go and what I should be doing while we are united. She shows me in my head through our union.

In the dream, I was back at my parents house and in the dream, was my mother and my brother (who is an adult now, but was a child in the dream). \nMy parents‚Äô dog had puppies and I was going to let them outside. When my mother, brother, and myself we‚Äôre outside with the puppies, a snake (which felt very evil) started swallowing the puppies whole. I ran to their shed to find something to kill it with, but as I was almost there, I heard bloodcurdling screams from my mother and brother. Just as I turned around, the snake was there and I woke up.\n\nAny idea what this could mean?"

    "body": "The first part of my dream I remember getting into this elevator with two other girls. As the door closed, we began to fall very fast. At first we thought the whole elevator was falling and we‚Äôd soon hit the bottom. We then realized that the top of of the elevator wasn‚Äôt moving at all. The bottom of the elevator had been a false bottom and we manage to grip on either side of the ‚Äúelevator walls‚Äù. We first tried climbing up but decided it‚Äôd be easier to climb down as long as we did not fall. It seemed to have gone on forever but when we reached the bottom, there was some sort of ramp. This was sort of mind boggling, because surely that fall would‚Äôve killed us and we would‚Äôve slid out at the bottom. We slowly slid out and found ourselves in some sort of factory. There were conveyor belts with packing boxes -just regular old cardboard boxes. \n\nI don‚Äôt remember much more, but the next part of the dream, we were stationed outside moving these large tubs - not the same as the packing boxes from before. There was a large building with two white folding tables and several large trucks surrounding the area. However there were a lot more women here and they are all quite young. There was an elder women yelling and ordering us to put the boxes under and on these tables, and to make sure they are sealed tightly before doing so. There was one with the top sitting on it with one corner of it being uncovered. A girl close by tripped into it and much faster than me and the other girls, she managed to grab onto the sides. I reached in to help pull her out. The lady began to yell and ask who left the box unsealed. A girl sepped forward to explain it was already unsealed and she was unsure of what to do. As the woman began to drag this girl away, I realized that this is very similar to what happened with the elevator, and I assumed all of these tubs contain endless holes, but don‚Äôt understand how. \n\nThe next part of the dream is a strange series of images and happenstances‚Ä¶ The one that sticks out to me the most is the image of a never ending staircase. I believe I have seen this illusion somewhere before, where someone seems to be running up a staircase that always leads back to the same place. But when the perspective is changed, the illusion breaks. I‚Äôve seen it in dreams before, and when I realize it the illusion breaks. Ive seen it in many different ways, but it seems like I see it all at once. One way is that u see the separation of the stairs, from beginning to end, sort of like a 3d model. Another way is as if I‚Äôm looking over the staircase into an abyss. The last way I watch as the person running on the stairs fall to their death‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt quite put these visuals into a specific place in my dream. They either occur before during or after the part I‚Äôm about to explain.\nThe next part of the dream, I am shackled to all the other women and we are walking up these stairs -not the same stairs I see in the visuals- I look up and see tattered wall paper and old portraits on the walls. The stairs have patterned carpet, and some of the flowers on the carpet have a shimmer to them. There are multiple staircases covered in these women, and the ceiling seems to be miles away. There are large men with face coverings guiding the women and belittling them.\n\nAt some point I have escaped these shackles and I‚Äôm running through these halls like I‚Äôm on a mission. I can see other people searching for me as I cause chaos throughout this mansion. I‚Äôm not sure what all I was doing to anger the people ‚Äúin charge‚Äù but the older woman is ordering the men previously mentioned to find me and sedate me. I realized that I can peel the wall back and sort of phase through to different rooms. When I do this it‚Äôs sort of wrapping myself into the wall like a blanket. This goes on forever and I can‚Äôt really explain all of the events that take place, but basically I‚Äôm traveling through the walls and I‚Äôm somewhat omniscient at this point. While running through a hallway, I run into a young man, he is much smaller than me he men previously mentioned. I realize I can take him with me when I go into the walls. As we phase in and out of the walls he gives me more information about what‚Äôs going on. We search the mansion to find more people who can be saved. However, I phase through a wall, and he does not come through with me. \n\nNow I gotta explain a reoccurring thing in my dreams to explain the last portion of this dream. This always occurs in different dreams, they never start the same. Something that is always the same though, is I‚Äôll walk into a room, and when I exit the room I‚Äôve entered what seems to be a completely different realm. I sort of glide across the floor here, and even float higher at times. This place is like a dark mysterious building but I can‚Äôt fully explain what it looks like. I can vividly see it in my mind, but it‚Äôs really weird. It‚Äôs sort of a collection of corridors, almost like a maze. The first time I had this happen I could hear a lot of voices telling me where to go and what to do, but the voices were conflicting with one another in what they were saying. The first time it took forever, but I end up at this ‚Äúwall‚Äù. This wall is a collection of colors and red beams. The colors are more like static, and the red beams bounce both back and forth and up and down. It is a very large wall, and I can‚Äôt decided if it‚Äôs safe to go through. I eventually decide there is nowhere else to go. I float upwards and through the wall, and once again everything has shifted. I‚Äôm sort of out of control in which way my body floats, and there are images and colors flying all around me. I‚Äôve had this happen in many dreams, but they seem to get closer and closer. The first reoccurrence was months after the first occurrence, and now I‚Äôve had it happen back to back. The first time it happened it took me forever to find this ‚Äúwall‚Äù and each time it seems to get easier and easier, like I just know where to go. In the dream I explained above, I immediately arrived at this ‚Äúwall‚Äù and went straight in. All the chaos started like normal, but I felt a sense of peace and maybe even control over this space."

We were in a house that kind of looked like my grandmas house in the front but the back was different. So like she was torturing me and another girl by slicing my fingers and like putting them in this weird device that peeled the skin back. Then she was having us do this to other people or we would get tortured more. There was a group of friends that lived across the street. We went over there to ‚Äúmake friends ‚Äú so we could set them up to bring them back to her. They were not very nice people and they were making fun of me and the other girl. Idk who she was. One of the girls was pretty mean so we chose her as the like sacrifice. Then there was an alligator that was walking around when we got back to my grandmas house. For a minute there was a counter like a restaurant there where the girl came. The alligator was trying to get her and came in the house. It tried to bite me too even though I wasn‚Äôt the target. I went to the back of the house to hide from it and locked the door. I found a notebook with letters from people who were tortured and killed under a pillow on the bed. I read them and then the lady who was torturing had a husband that came. He turned her into the police and I was skeptical because why did he wait so long. Was he part of it the whole time? Then I woke up. \n\n\nI have had dreams like this since I was a little girl for example, when I was young I still remember this dream where I went into my parents room and saw two demons jumping on their bed and (I used to be religious at this time) I was like in the name of jesus blah blah and they laughed at me and said you really think that will work üíÄ \n\nLet me know what you guys think could be the interpretation of the dream from last night because idk"

The teacher was saying something and I remember giggling with a girl next to me about something. The teacher told me to please be quiet and said something else rude.

I used to sleep in the \"big bed\" with her until I was I guess like 5 or 6 years old. The nightmare was always like this: in my sleep, I woke up for something, I don't know I needed to drink or go to the bathroom, and I looked beside me to see my mother sleeping on her side giving me her back. So I got out of bed, did my things and went to the kitchen, where I would find my mother doing something like cooking and be like \"Oh you woke up\", leaving me with the question of who actually was sleeping beside me in the bed.\n\nI remember doing this dream all the time and be engulfed in a sense of complete dread and despair.\n\nNow I'm 30 years old and I'm having another recurring nightmare regarding my mother for the last couple of weeks. I find this peculiar because it's the second instance in my entire life in which I explicitly remember having the same nightmare more than once, and also so close to the first time, and this one is also about my mother (which, for context, is still alive and totally fine).\n\nI dream that we have a terrible fight, like screaming and berating one another in terrible ways, and then she dies. Not only she dies, she has an actual ictus right between my arms, like it's activated by her rage or her screaming. The dream is extremely brutal and graphic: I don't know how an ictus actually works, but her face basically melts in front of me, like half of it, while she screams something along the line \"Oh God I'm dying, I'm dying\". \n\nIt kinda impressed me. My mother's fine and while we don't agree all the time we're in a totally normal mother-son relationship and absolutely nothing out of the ordinary happened in the last few weeks or months.

Moreover, the dream foretells wealth, fame and happiness that is knocking on your door. Dreaming of fish predicts that you will inherit a huge fortune from your family. It is expected that with this money you do not have to do anything, you can live comfortably until the end of your life. However, the dream interpretation advises you to try to build your career because gambling will have a mountain of gold.\r  \n\r  \nThe meaning lies in the dream of seeing carp\r  \nTo dream of a fish is a good omen, fortune and prosperity will come to you in the near future. However, if you dream that a golden carp is eaten by a crocodile, it is a harbinger of trouble. It is best during this period to limit going out and be wary of strangers. When someone you're not familiar with taking leave will help you, and you can best solve the problem on your own by refusing to accept that help.\n\n\r\r  \nDreaming of dead fish  \nIt is a bad omen, a sign of the end of a relationship, things that should not be kept should be given up. Not only that, but this dream also helps you to put your past behind and move towards a better future.

I will be in the middle of walking on the road and realize I forgot my shoes. It's always the case of me forgetting them. I will also realize halfway through my journey and then I will start worrying about where my shoes are, which makes whatever I'm trying to do/the place I'm trying to get to more stressful. I am just wondering what this means."

    "body": "*scene*\n\nI pull up to a parking lot at a park, having just spent the day, apparently my day off, playing basketball, skateboarding, and generally filling my day with things I enjoy. It's about 4:30 - 5:00 pm outside, and I proceeded to get out of my car and go for a walk in the park while sparking a joint.\n\nAs I get out, there is a mid 30's, brown haired, somewhat chubby, hippy dressed, red satchel wearing gentleman in a second, dirt parking lot in front of me, playing his guitar, singing, and dancing with some pretty decent talent. I spark my joint and watch, standing there, transfixed by his happiness. As I puff on my joint and head out for my walk, he approaches me.\n\n\"Awesome bro!\" I tell him, with a miniature applause. \"I really enjoyed your performance!\" I still have about a third of the joint left, so I hand it to him with the classic stoner 'Ere!, and ask him about himself.\n\nImmediately, it becomes apparent that he wasn't really all there. His singing did not transfer to being able to formulate real speech, and he definitely seemed nonverbal. I try to talk to him a while, telling him about my day, that I also play guitar and sing, and some other things, but eventually I give up and go on my walk. The walk is a fast forward in dream time, but I remember watching the sun start to descend.\n\nWhen I get back to the parking lot, I see him on the sidewalk of the dirt lot, rocking and fiddling and stimming in a mad, autistic sort of way. Realizing he is homeless, I want to help him. When I approach and ask him his name, and if I could get him some food or anything, he is just completely unaware of the world around him. I try for a bit to get his attention, but when I notice he still has the joint as I had handed it to him, unsmoked and intact, I give up and back away.\n\nAs I start my car, I notice his red satchel in the parking spot next to me, underneath the tire of another vehicle. I get out, pick it up and dust it off. Heading over to return it to him, I am already getting emotional at the sad sight of this man.\n\n\"Hey buddy,\" I say as I approach. \"You dropped your bag!\" I squat in front of him and try to hand it back, but he still doesn't notice me. Try as I might to break him of his trance, he just isn't in this world at the time. \"I'm just going to set it down here next to you, okay? Don't forget it again! I'm sure it's important.\"\n\nAt this point night has fallen, and the moon is bright. I start to turn away before standing up, and as soon as my eyes are off of him I am startled to feel his hand snatch my wrist. I turn back in shock, and he is looking at me with a piercing gaze, tears in his eyes.\n\n\"Thank you.\" He says.\n\nI immediately start to cry. Sobbing, I reach into my pocket saying, \"Can I please show you something?\" He nods, and as I pull out my phone to show him a picture of my real life 6 week old baby daughter, as I look at the phones screen...\n\n*scene*\n\nI wake up. With actual tears in my eyes, and still in the swings of a 1¬∞-1.5¬∞ fever.\n\nUpon waking, I definitely felt frustrated that I woke up before showing him the picture. It felt really important for some reason. I've been crying on and off since this dream, I honestly don't remember the last time I was this emotional for this long, if ever.\n\nI have an instinctual interpretation of this, but I want to hear what other people say without influencing your interpretation.\n\nThanks for reading."

It was vivid to where I remember this red/bloody moon that was getting bigger and a sense of fear, I also remembered that I could feel the world was about to end, the worst sense of doom. Then I can‚Äôt remember exactly but some kind of explosion or maybe the sun hit the earth. I just remember the feelings were so real and terrible but the only talking/interaction was the very end where I had this intense feeling that I just had to get the words ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù out of my mouth right before it was over/the world ends. I was needing to tell my kids, they are 3 and almost 5. I just cant shake the intense feeling at the end and it almost ended with relief, SO bizarre. \n\nI will add that my mom and sister and I are very open about our dreams since I was young. I have had dreams about family members passing before someone actually passes. I know it sounds crazy, but I am completely being  honest. My mom actually takes all of my vivid dreams serious. I am the youngest of 5, I have 3 brothers and a sister.\n\nThe last time I had a very emotional feeling dream was about my brother. I had dreamt that I was in this courtyard with pillars everywhere, kids waking around too. I was trying to get to my bother, I knew something was wrong but I didn‚Äôt know what. The emotion and feelings of dread and fear were so intense I woke up and started crying which I‚Äôve never done. I was just following him trying to get to him but he was just always right out of reach. Nothing bad happened in my dream but the bad feeling only intensified. I‚Äôll never forget this feeling, it felt like my soul was being ripped out of me.\n\nA week after this dream, my brother (same from my dream) almost died from a bowel perforation and the radiologist missed it TWICE. I‚Äôm a nurse, but I saw him in the hospital for the two days and the exact feelings from the dream I had in real life. I was actually physically feeling sick and so scared that this was actually happening. I had to tell the nurse that he was not ok and eventually was able to get a doctor in the room on the 3rd day. They called a rapid response immediately when the doc saw how terrible he looked; dusky. Within 2 hours he was in emergency surgery. I literally saved him, he was so close to the end it was unreal. They never figured out why or what caused this random perforation and he has no history. \n\nI have not been the same since this happened last March. I actually finally went for Cognitive processing therapy and realized I had ptsd from it all and thankfully doing much better.\nI just wanted to give a background on my dream history because I have had a hard time processing my dreams after it happening to my brother.\n\nFor once, nothing stressful or crazy is happening in my life. I have autoimmune disease that has been affecting my muscles and heart rate more, I wondered if it‚Äôs maybe anxiety that something is going to happen to me?"

I found a room where tons of people where waiting sitting (god knows why). I saw in the crowd a very handsome blonde dude with a giant beard, and I started approaching him to ask him for his instagram. He smiled at me and we started talking. I take out my phone to give him my number and when I look back at him, it turns out im talking to a totally different guy, a small, bald dude with red eyes and a creepy smile. I give him my number still, thinking I might have messed up and talked to the wrong person, but when he's about to take it I spring from my sit and start running for my life and that's where I wake up.\n\nWhat does it mean??

The room wasn't completely dark, it was partially lit by one of those old low quality yellow basement lights. In this room were three distinct things, a concrete beam in the middle of it, the lower half of a plastic bottle to catch water droplets that were dripping from the ceiling that was pretty low and one of those old wooden chairs facing the beam. For some reason I can't explain, I felt this otherwordly sense of dread and terror, I was almost having a panic attack, I felt my heart racing, was developing tunnel vision, my throat drying up and my eyes popping out of my head just looking at this room. The rest of the dream i do not remember, just this part. I've been thinking about this dream the whole day and I still do not understand why I felt this primal level of terror just looking at this room, I don't know why but I'm positive that it was supernatural."

    "body": "**Some background:** He was a poor communicator unless we were in person and would constantly let me down, \"forget\" or go back on promises made. It was clear he didn't care or couldn't be bothered with me if i got too much for him i guess. I'd just be ignored until i waited long enough for him to reply or i essentially,  blew up his phone. which was usually what happened. I'd vent my frustrations, try to distance, ghost him even but he would act hurt by those actions and want me to \"come back\" to the friendship but never compromised on what i asked of him. Once he moved away, he didn't care about maintaining the friendship. It was rough but i eventually and finally removed him and stuck to it. With that out of the way let's get to the dreams...\n\nI've had about 3 vivid dreams about him. To preface, I don't remember my dreams. Ever. (Aka i dont dream) but whenever i wake up from a full rest and go back to sleep to catch some extra Zzz's, thats when i get the weirdest dreams like being young again with all my elementary class mates going through this maze like house while everyone is roasting/bullying me or trying to fight someone but my arms are like wet noodles no matter how hard i swing. I try to run away but im slower than a snail despite going full speed.\n\nWith him, the dreams were EXTREMELY WHOLESOME (he, irl is an antisocial loner who ill look you dead in the eye and walk away mid conversation if he doesn't know you and doesn't want to talk). The first one was last year so the memory has faded but the second one happened  a little over a month ago. I was in Laos and strangely i was there with the side of my family i dont like. It was a good time. Everyone was having fun on the beach, by the water etc. I went in to some sort of beach restaurant and i saw him from the corner of my eye but wasn't sure if he saw me, I avoided him and went back to my family. I see him walk by while im with them but this time we make eye contact. I don't acknowledge i just kind of act like i looked past him. I go back to the place where i first saw him (i think for food, idk its a dream lol) and he sees me again, eye contact again, but this time i smile but still look away. Next thing i know he's approaching me and he is in full uniform (Air force vet but was wearing a Marine uniform in my dream. Idk why) in front of me catching up with me and we end up just talking and walking along the beach and i eventually go my separate ways back to my family and then i wake up.\n\nThe reason i think im in Laos or even Vietnam at this time is because before i stopped talking to him, he was vacationing in one of these places which I also plan to go to for my own trip when im older. But I don't understand why i was having a good time with people I personally cutted out of my life.\n\nThe second dream i had today. Same situation of falling asleep again. I was with friends in this dream and we were having a good time (outside settingni believe. We were on a bench) then he appears and again, same old catching up but he's completely changed in physical appearance this time. He had outrageous ink and piercings and facial implants, grew his hair out longer than before had a whole different style too. It surprisingly didn't turn me away, i still found him easy on the eyes in the face. In this dream he was a lot more openly affectionate: hugs, sitting close, forehead kisses and just seeming like he changed but it was a maaaajor 180. All of these gestures I did not reciprocate or acknowledge. I just smiled and continue whatever i was doing.\n\nI guess what i want to know is, why am I having better-than-reality dreams about someone who I have long since cut off and want nothing to do with anymore? I genuinely dont miss him. He made me feel shitty about myself without even trying. And I went quite a long time (little over 3 months) without a thought or care or regard in the world about him. He is absolutely a chapter close. And yet my dreams make me feel like there's such a high possibility of us running in to each other again (there's not, i promise) if we do i will not act like everything is fine like i did last time. I will call him out and want answers if i ever have the displeasure of meeting him again. \n\nSo why the wholesome shit brain???"

I don't remember the exact chronology of my dream but parts of it, which I will try to restitute :\n ‚Ä¢I remember being inside a sort of narrow towel entirely made up of stairs. I was surrounded by a thick crowd of persons, and most of them climbed up, but for some reason, I decided to follow two women who were climbing down. I extirpated myself of the ascending group and walked behind the two women. They were tidyly dressed, and I had a sudden spike of feeling powerful and special walking in the steps of these two non-conforming and supposedly clever and upper-classed ladies. I instantly visualized in my mind's eye myself wearing the same clothes as theirs and imitating their assertive attitude, which made me feel superior. But as we were progressing down, the stairs got completely tangled. But when I say tangled, I really mean it. Some parts of it even were more scale-looking, it was a mess. One woman disappeared, and the other tried not to fall. Her look turned less classy, and I could finally see her face. She had an exagerated expression of fear, and seemed way more ordinary than I had thought earlier. Concerning me, I was afraid of losing control and falling, everything around me was flimsy and cracked.\n ‚Ä¢Later in the dream, I was back home. I saw my cat and advanced towards her, but I felt something different about her. When I approached her, I coud remove her skin and fur. My real cat smelt her, shocked, and I didn't know how to react.

    "body": "I had this strange dream just now.  There was a large cat, maybe about 3 feet long from head to butt (not including her tail), that was following me. Her fur was a deep royal blue color. At first I thought it was the sun shining off of black fur, but it was actually a deep blue color which I found very strange.\n\nAnyway, she followed me throughout this small unknown town and I was a little nervous. She was a *very* large cat after all. When I turned to see where she was, she was right at my heels. She sat down, looked up at me with kindness in her eyes, and jumped! She jumped up into my arms. She let me hold her like you would a child on your hip.\n\nThe purring...oh, that deep peaceful purr that emanated from her. I felt that vibration on my chest and shoulder. It felt nice. I honestly was a little bummed that I woke up. I carried that cat through this town for a while.\n\nI stopped at a gas station, apparently my landlord owned it. I told the man that I was going to drop off my rent check but actually had forgotten it. He was okay with it, but was *very* nervous about my new friend, haha. \n\nAny idea what this deep royal blue colored cat means? She was as sweet as pie....she made me feel so comforted and loved. The vibrations of her purrs made me feel so at peace. This dream is definitely a nice change from the parade of nightmares I've had for the last few weeks. Any help would mean the world to me, thank you! üíú"

    "body": "About a month ago, I had a very strange and memorable dream about someone I‚Äôve only ever seen a few times in an old photograph, about 110 years old. The person in question, for whatever reason, did have a vague sort of familiarity to them, but I have not been able to place my finger on a relation to any person I‚Äôve met in my waking life. A few weeks after seeing the photo, I had pretty much not thought about it much at all, until I went to sleep on a Friday night, and had this dream. In the dream, I appeared on a dirt path running from left to right, with an old house directly in front of me. Everything in the dream was in black and white. The girl from the photo was standing in the doorway, and behind her, inside the house, was pure pitch blackness. When we saw each other, there was a moment of extreme elation between both of us, and we met each other on the porch of this house and hugged, both very happy to see each other. Like two old friends meeting after many years. The dream then skipped to what I thought was the inside of this house, sitting on an old style couch. We were sitting side by side, looking rigidly straight ahead. We never turned to look at each other, but I could see her also looking straight ahead in my peripheral vision. Ahead of me, I could see only a sparse wooden plank floor stretching on for about 15 feet, and then it faded to just darkness. I could not see the end of the room. For whatever reason, I became aware that we were unable to speak to each other, but we could sort of feel each others emotions, and we were surrounded by the most warm happy feeling, like just so happy to even exist next to each other. And then, she simply leaned over, and pushed her left cheek against my right cheek, and it was extremely surprising to me in the dream. I could feel every detail of her face. It was the most real and detailed physical sensation I‚Äôve ever had in a dream. She then simply pulled away without a word, and we continued to stare straight on into this darkness. The dream then skipped to us in a standing position, her directly in front of me with her back to me, and me with my hands on both of her shoulders from behind, still just looking straight ahead. I made note of how small and fragile her frame felt, too small for her, and it concerned me for a moment. She was shorter than me, coming up to about the bottom of my chin, and I could just make out the top and back of her head as we both looked forward. It then felt like she took me to a doorway, still in the same position as before, except now we were looking into a small ornate mirror on the wall inside this room. And we just stood there, staring at ourselves in this mirror, still surrounded by that same incredible warm feeling from before. She wore the slightest smirk on her face as we looked into the mirror, and I noted to myself that she was really pretty. And then it was over."

    "body": "Monday, May 22\n\nLast night I had a dream about me, a girl, and time travel\n\nSo it started off with me and my friends at a convention for our school or something. I'm guessing it was for jobs after high-school. Anyway, I was hanging out and I started talking to this girl named Maddison Duley. She was a popular girl at my school. After a little bit of talking, we snuck off to the shipping bay of the building we were in.(the building was kinda like a supermarket) After talking about us and what we like and just getting to know each other better, I leaned in to kiss her and it she was laying on the floor I was over top of her with my eyes facing her chin. She said \"No, we are not kissing upside down, come over here and kiss me normally\". We did and when I opened my eyes, I was back in my chair from a couple hours earlier. After the convention finished, I realized that I had the ability to time travel and I don't know how I got it. I went to my best friend Jesse and I said the following (his mom was taking us home) \"Jesse, so I have the ability to time travel, don't ask how, I don't know. Anyways, I was talking to a girl and I kissed her. I had her, you know? I got a girlfriend! But then I accidentally timetravelled mid kiss and now I'm worried I won't ever get her back!\" \"What do I do?\" Jesse said \"idk man, if you really want this girl then no offense to my mom but screw her and go get her\" to this I said \"thanks bro, I love you\" and ran off to go get her.\n\nI made it in the building and then got arrested by the in building police because of disorderly conduct because apparently I was making a ruckus by running around the building looking for Maddison. As I was sitting in this tiny silverish black cell, I saw two guards outside at a long control panel facing away from the cell sitting down. Outside the cell, there was another inmate named Hunter Bryd sitting at the control panel with the guards. Our outfits were teal btw. Anyways, I had enough and time traveled to get out of this but little did I know I traveled back to a few minutes before I kissed Maddison and this time travel sent me to the timeline where I kissed and disappeared from her. I unknowingly went looking for her and couldn't find her. I decided to go back to my cell and serve my short time there (about 2 hours). I saw that they didn't even know I was gone because the two guards and hunter were watching a movie on a projector. I served my last 10 minutes and walked out. I tore off the prison stuff and it had my normal cloths underneath. As I walked down this white hallway, I saw a senior I knew, Ella. She knew Maddison. I ran to her and asked her if she has seen Maddison. She said to come with her because she was the head of security cameras. As I walked into her room, Maddison came down the hallway crying. At that moment, I realized that I was back in my original timeline. I ran to Maddison and asked her what's wrong. She kept crying. I asked her if she wanted to go to a place more private to talk and she said yes. We walked to Ella's room because I knew Ella didn't mind. When we got in there, we laid on the bed and I tried to talk to her. She pushed me over on my back and tried to straddle me. She asked what I wanted and I said \"I want you to be my girlfriend.\" She seemed upset and confused by this. I assume it was because I didn't explain my sudden disappearance. She ran out crying and I chased after her. \n\nThat is all I remember from this dream."

    "body": "hi! i‚Äôm very curious what this dream symbolizes to y‚Äôall. \n\nlast night i had a dream involving one headless snake and two snakes with heads. the headless snake was wrapped in a sheet, but it was still very much alive. i don‚Äôt remember the full context of the dream, but i remember running past the headless snake. it was slithering very quickly along with me - not really chasing me, just going in the same direction as me. the front half of it was standing up straight and writhing all around while it was slithering. you couldn‚Äôt actually see that it was headless because the sheet was covering it, but i was just very aware that it had no head. there was a man running behind me. i knew him in my dream, but he isn‚Äôt actually someone i know in real life. he told me that the people we were running to meet had chopped off the snake‚Äôs head. i remember saying they shouldn‚Äôt have done that because the snake wasn‚Äôt even venomous. then at some point, we stumbled upon 2 more snakes that i think were rattlesnakes. we were all going in the same direction. \n\nnone of the snakes were trying to hurt us, and i don‚Äôt remember feeling scared of any of them. i just remember wanting to help fix the headless one. i have no idea where we running or who we were meeting or why. i really just remember this part about the snakes."

This wasn't abnormal as she always slept with us since she was a baby. \nI stopped in the doorway because floating above her was a giant eye. It was like it was scanning her or studying her. It wasn't harming her and I didn't feel scared at all. It floated above her looking at her, then looked over at me briefly, I was still standing in the doorway, and then went back to looking at her. Then I noticed my daughter's eyes were rolled back in her head, but again, I didn't feel anxiety like in a nightmare. It was very vivid and I woke up questioning if it had actually happened. \nSomeone interpreted this dream for me when I had it 10+ years ago, but I cant find the interpretation and wondered if I would get the same interpretation a second time too. \nDoes anyone know the meaning behind this dream? for my daughter and/or me?"

    "body": "Had an intense dream last night. I had a dream that my mom and I were going hiking, down this path that was very familiar to me. It stared out with us getting in inner tubes and floating down the river to get to the actual path. So we‚Äôre on the river and I remembered that there were alligators in this river, and as I was wondering to myself when alligator season starts, I looked down and saw one getting ready to chomp off my toe. Then another one comes up and tries to chomp off my other toe. Then there are two more behind those two waiting to get at me. I called for my mom, she realizes I‚Äôm stuck, pulls on my inner tube, and we float on down the river. \nSo now the river part of that journey is over, I go to start on the walking path, look up, see my mom is a little ways ahead. She waves and stops to wait for me. I wave, put my head down to continue the path, and when I get to where she was, she‚Äôs gone. I start calling for her and as I‚Äôm calling, I‚Äôm beginning to realize how heavily trafficked this path is. There‚Äôs people crawling everywhere (I am from a tourist town, and that was the setting for this dream) there was a little area off to the side that had small water pools, so I went over there, she was not there. I looked everywhere, kept screaming her name, nothing. \nSo eventually, a friend of mine from high school and her mom come out of their house (which was right off the path) because they could hear me yelling. So they tell me to come inside, I tell them what happened. They told me to call my dad and the police. Then I go outside,  desperately look for her one more time. I can‚Äôt find her so scream her name as loud as I can, I see the look of pity on my friend and her mom‚Äôs face, and then right as I‚Äôm waking up, I come to the realization that she either got abducted, or eaten by alligators because she didn‚Äôt know that she was supposed to look out for them. \n\nAnd a common thing that I kept saying and feeling was that it was literally like 5 minutes between when I looked up and waved at her, and when I got to where she was waving at me from. And how could she go missing in that short of a period of time?"

I stop to grab a single orange delphinium and continue on my way to school (now walking). \n\nMajor train tracks run through my hometown. As I was walking, ahead there was a stationary train about to depart. It was cargo toward the rear, two vagrants were train hopping. The train starts to leave, one gets on, the second throws his bag up but quickly the space to jump is too great and he misses it. \n\nSuddenly, I‚Äôm now on the train. In a passenger carriage. The dirty vagrants are next to me, the one who missed saunters in and sits down with his friends. We are moving quickly. We aren‚Äôt going to school, it doesn‚Äôt stop there like I thought it did. That‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll get off at the next stop. The next stop is somewhere unfamiliar to me. It‚Äôs high in mountains. We‚Äôve travelled through tunnels to get there. We pull into the station. It‚Äôs a dead-end, the last stop. I leave the train-station quickly because I feel anxious, I want to walk back to my hometown. \n\nI have to walk down the mountain. It‚Äôs a rocky ravine, it‚Äôs dangerous - like a goat-track and I‚Äôm scared. I have a sandwich with me and I don‚Äôt want to drop it over the side. There‚Äôs all sorts of hazards including slippery plastic on the track. Two 30-40yo women are coming up. They have sneakers on. I don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre better prepared than I am. They tell me that I‚Äôm going the wrong way. If I carry on, it‚Äôs a 3 hour journey to the next town (which is in the wrong direction I want to travel in). \n\nI look around to try and see landmarks. I‚Äôm confused because the landmarks keep changing. Now the ladies have told me where I am, I can orient myself. I‚Äôll have to go back up to the train-station to return to town after all, it‚Äôs the safest option. \n\nSo I‚Äôm climbing back up. All of a sudden there‚Äôs all these grandmas climbing toward the train station. I ask if they can hold my sandwich in their handbag so that I can climb up too. I‚Äôve removed the plastic from the ledge so that everyone can walk smoothly and won‚Äôt slip. The old lady directly behind me grudgingly puts my sandwich in her bag, but she wants to get past me. We take a couple steps before she hands my sandwich back and tells me that I better look after it if I want to get back. \n\nShe pulls out a map (it looks like the marauders map from Harry Potter, it‚Äôs a magic map) and it starts self-drawing to reveal the route the train took through the tunnels and mountains. It‚Äôs not at all the route I thought I was going. Now I‚Äôm going up to the train to catch it back to my hometown to start over. \n\nNote: I lived in two towns, one aged 0-14 and a second 14-18. This setting is the latter. I now (31) live overseas &amp; have for a decade. I was my current-age in this dream."

I know what I seek In partner and stick to my standards, therefore I‚Äôve never had a serious long term committed relationship, even though I‚Äôve har countless prospects. I deeply desire to find true love and become a mother, and because of my isolation and my age I worry that it won‚Äôt happen."

(I know it's weird, and I might have issues) and I really wanna know it means. Hope you guys can help, thank you in advance. \n\nSorry for my bad English."

    "body": "Ever since I turned 20. I sometimes dream of asteroids or some other type of huge rock hitting the earth. I always see it from my point of view. Like so huge I can see it spinning in the atmosphere. But last night was different. I was in my house with my front door wide open. It was night and there was a howling wind along with bright flashing lights which I can only describe as looking like explosions of plasma or an aurora borealis. The weirdest part was I flicked as switch which was supposed to be the light for my porch. Instead it turned on the sun? Weird I know but once I turned it back off I saw multiple huge rocks heading towards us. And all of a sudden my grandmother appeared, who is still living, and she let out this huge expression of fear. The physical sensation of fear I felt was so great it woke me up.\n\nWhenever I have these dreams, something bad usually follows in my life. I think it‚Äôs because I fly out tomorrow to head back home and my anxiety when it comes to flying kicks in."

    "body": "My last girlfriend and I broke up towards the end of last year, it was a pretty bad break up and we haven‚Äôt been in communication since aside from once when she messaged me and told me she missed me (we went no contact after that). Without getting to much into the relationship it wasn‚Äôt very healthy and I was very unhappy. we tried ending on a amicable note and we expressed that maybe we could try being friends in the future but we went no contact and I‚Äôve been trying to move forward with my own life and let go. \n\nA few months ago I dreamt that we were in a school setting, which was odd because her and I didn‚Äôt go to the same school. In this dream she was sitting right in front of me turned away from me and it felt like both of us were mad at each other and we were trying our best to ignore each other. I kind of waved that dream off because I had had a few dreams about her   And I just chalked it up to residual feelings. \n\nLast night or this morning I had another dream about her and it was also in a school setting. This time we weren‚Äôt by each other but I kept seeing her amongst a other students. She was looking at me and she looked sad, and I felt like she wanted to come talk to me but she didn‚Äôt. In the dream I also felt like I wanted to talk to her but I didn‚Äôt and I walked to a different area where I couldn‚Äôt see her. Normally I wave ex dreams off as just my subconscious still holding onto things but I found it weird that I‚Äôve had two very similar dreams about her and they were both in a school setting with similar themes. I was looking into dream meanings and stumbled across this sub, would anyone have any insight on why my dreams seem to have the same theme? Thank you"

    "body": "Any help would be lovely and appreciated.\n\nSo the dream started with myself and my family being in this kind of compound (which I wouldn‚Äôt even know what that would be like) with was another massive family- potentially Italian I believe because there is a mob type vibe about it, not to stereotype- and we were all integrated, and my sister was sitting down and eating, and I went to go sit down next to her and eat as well. It was a little dingy in there, and it was very, very shot back; it was a massive room, full of all the same furniture (it all went together very well) and the family was mostly men. And I think the reason why we were there is because I started dating an Italian man with possibility of being the head, or soon to be, of his family‚Äôs mafia.\nMy sister, as old as we are, still likes to try and embarrass me IRL. She told me something along the lines of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt sit down and eat, you‚Äôve already eaten and you at least need to dress nicer‚Äú but a little meaner and snarky. Mind you, I was the one that got us in with this family because of someone‚Äôs interest in me, someone who wants to potentially marry me thus introducing our families together, someone thinks highly of me enough to do this, they think I‚Äôm beautiful and worthy no matter what. \nSo, biting my tongue, I walked away and said nothing, even though I wanted more than anything to verbally lash out at her due to how deeply she hurt my feelings. I went to go find our mother to go sit with and just sit with because she has a tendency of taking my sister side‚Ä¶ So I knew I couldn‚Äôt vent to her about the situation, I just wanted to be around someone I knew and try to calm down. \n\nThe dream transitions.\n\nNow we‚Äôre outside the compound, and my sister wanted to take a carriage, and I suppose I was the only one that was allowed to drive it. She said ‚ÄúI want to go to the Galleria.‚Äù my response to that was, ‚ÄúHow on earth, do you expect us to go to the galleria in a horse-drawn carriage? It‚Äôll take forever!‚Äù Still I thought maybe I can appease her by taking a little short drive. So she told me to just use the white one. It‚Äôs a single person one and it‚Äôs just four of us (two being her small children), so I abide her request and go and try to retrieve the carriage; It was in a little barn above a pond, and once I went to go get it, it was just a re-purposed washer with wheels. üôÑ"

I had a dream maybe a month ago, I was at my dad's house and there was a ghost in the bathroom. I had holy water and just kept it with me. Eventually I got along with it and became friends. It turns out it was not a ghost but a demon. After a while he decided to show himself, i went outside and he revealed himself to me. He was Lucifer. I was gapping at how beutiful he was. Not like I was attracted but I was in awe. I was so emotional and in awe that I fell to my knees and started crying while holding him. I felt that feeling deep down in my soul. I woke up and I still felt the feeling. It's one of the strongest dreams I've had. A deep part of me wants it to mean somthing.

(21 now) For a long time I felt very mistreated by her because she would say or do hurtful things and not take my feelings seriously. She has severe mental health issues so I couldn't really stay mad at her since I was scared for her health, and little worried about being alone cause I had a hard time connecting with other people.\n\nWe lived together 2 years ago for 6 months. She was a horrible roommate and bit before she moved away she cut her wrists right Infront of me during an argument. I have currently taken distance from her but still share mutual friends.\n\nThe dream itself:\nI lived in my parents house with my family. For some reason this childhood friend also lived with us. It started with a really childish argument about what fictional character we were allowed to like. She wanted to have one of mine I have had for a long time and didn't want to give her. She ended up getting so mad she cried about how unfair it was while wrestling with me. Then she left mad and even though she didn't really say anything I knew if I did anything that made her more mad something really bad would happen to me.\n\nI saw her again in the kitchen while making food for everyone and seeing me made her so mad that she straight up said she would stab me and kill me if I did anything else. I went to my mum's room and cried to her how horrible my friend is. The whole time I was a bit scared she would hear and hurt me or someone else in my family. Mum comforted me by saying how horrible my friend is and what she did was illegal.

    "body": "\r  \n**What is the dream meaning of not wearing clothes?**\n\nDreaming of being naked has several meanings. All are reflections of the present mind of the dreamer. It could be a problem that has been reported and needs to be fixed, or it could just be a re-enactment of what the dreamer had in mind.\r  \n\r  \nMany people believe that dream interpretation is extremely necessary because it can give you omens about the past, present or future in study, work, health, love, etc.\r  \n\r  \nTo dream that you are naked indicates that you are deliberately running away. This dream also represents being shunned, hated, afraid of being ridiculed by others.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are in a new love and dream of being naked, this dream suggests that you are nervous or afraid to express your thoughts and feelings to that person.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, this is just one of the ways to interpret the dream of seeing yourself without clothes. Because in each dream, the circumstances, details and images appear different. Therefore, in order to know the most specific and accurate omens, we must interpret separately in each specific case.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream interpretation of not wearing clothes good or bad?**\r  \nAccording to experts, dreams involving naked people often reflect things related to all your relationships. Specifically, the dream owner will meet the market in the near future. Therefore, you need to pay more attention to every word, including yourself.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming of walking but not wearing clothes**\r  \nIn your dream, you see yourself walking through a crowd of people naked. What does this undressed dream imply? This dream shows that you are a person who is easily hurt or embarrassed in front of others.\n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;See more:** [**https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/**](https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/)\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being naked in the classroom, at work**\r  \nIf you dreamed that you were naked at work, in class, such a dream indicates that you are not really ready for a certain plan. You feel stressed and confused when making decisions, especially when the attention of many people makes this problem even more serious.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream of not wearing clothes but no one notices**\r  \nIf in your dream appears the image of you naked but no one notices or notices that. This dream shows that your fears are completely unfounded. You yearn for more people to notice you.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being proud of my nudes**\r  \nIf one day you dream that you are naked but completely proud and unashamed, it is a sign that you are a free spirit. You always feel proud of yourself and your mood is always comfortable and happy.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming that I was stripped of my clothes, without a piece of cloth to cover my body**\r  \nTo dream that you are stripped of your clothes, without a piece of cloth, indicates that you have recently been entangled in some bad things, many rumors are not good for you. They make you feel humiliated and ashamed. You feel scared and worried if you let other people know. What you need to do is stay calm so you can handle things."

Not a single sting, but I was still afraid of the bees and kept running, tried to keep my mouth closed to avoid swallowing bees and hoped none would end up in my eyes.\n\nThen I jumped into a small pond with crystal clear water to escape and looked up.

(I don't go to college) There was a really bad accident at a roundabout we were crossing through, and one of the vehicles actually went up into the air, and landed partially on her.

I was too upset to eat, but my abusive ex wife came over to talk to me. She offered me a ride home, and I hesitantly accepted. Her passenger car door and window were both broken, and I had to stick my arm out the window and hold onto the door from the outside to keep it closed. I end up slicing my arm really bad, and she wouldn't take me to the hospital. She said it was for my own good, because I don't have health insurance.

    "body": "Hi for some background context my dad has been dead since 2010. I was 9 when he passed so I've spent more of my life without him than I did with him, and the rest of my family has/had a much closer relationship to him. I always lived with my mother while he traveled for work and only visited us occasionally. I wasn't even a person, or I didn't feel in control of my actions yet when he passed away (by suicide). The manner of death has caused me to feel a kind of way and re-evaluate all the interactions I remember having with him which tend to skew negative. Like I feel guilty for not wanting to do something because maybe if I did he wouldn't have or I feel angry that he didn't try to see me grow up. Anyway I know that's not my fault but that is easier to say than it is to believe. \n\nI continue to have complicated feelings about it to this day, but basically today is his birthday and in a month will be the 13 year anniversary of his death. This may have stirred things up because I was keeping myself aware of it so that I could text my mom and offer comfort if she needed it. However, I've never had a dream directly about him before now. If anything, it was mentioned in passing or was implied, but I never had physically seen him in my dreams that I can remember. And since its been over a decade we don't really feel impacted by the anniversary unless its like a big one. \n\nNow onto the dream. In the dream I was myself as a child, probably around the age that he died and we were in a house I was unfamiliar with. So in my early childhood, my parents were off and on and in this dream my dad came home with a new girlfriend. She seemed nice enough and really supported him to the point of slightly disliking myself, my sister, and my mom. But this led to us not liking her all that much, so it was suggested that I scare her. I put on some three part black outfit, I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be and hid behind a door. When she opened it, I kinda hissed but I didn't get a reaction. Then I think one of them said they were going to take our cat (or I felt like it was implied that they were going to hurt it - which is not something he would do as a person but mirrors a situation where I thought he had cremated our cat when I was very young) so I was naturally very mad and upset. I grabbed the cat and ran into a bedroom, I did not see my dad for the remainder of the dream nor did he say anything else, but I remember that I suddenly felt the anger, sadness, and disappointment he felt about me and my actions. I started crying unconsolably for several minutes because it felt like he would never forgive me. \n\nThen it was like a hard cut to a school theatre play I was doing tech for (so random but I did do this in middle school). I thought he would come out to at least support me, but when I walked outside to find my parents after it was done, I only saw my mom. I began crying super hard again which is when my mom introduced me to some guy that I don't recognize from my real life. But again I had the feeling that he knew my dad and he was trying to console me by telling me about a similar situation he had been in or something. That's when I got a phone call and woke up, but I just feel super gross and really bad about the dream and would like to understand it. Is it just a manifestation of that scenario that actually happened or something deeper? Also like why now?"

I had bought a very old run down house with old furnishings etc still there, it looked to have been well lived in but completely abandoned with everything still there. It was like a maze too, so many rooms and floors. I was exploring the house and trying to do a bit of tidying up, when in one of the bathrooms I found a bath that was part of the structure, like an old Roman type bath maybe. I turned the water on to try and test it to make sure it actually worked, when water started flowing into the bath a massive bunch of spiders (huge spiders üò≥üò≥) came running out the wall attached to the bath. I freaked out and turned the water off, they ran back into the wall. Left the room and explored more, went into another room and found a large bunch of cats that were mostly feral but they were actually very healthy looking. Some of them were friendly, others were hissing at me, others were distant but curious. First thought was to call SSPCA as a bunch of abandoned cats, wanted them to be rescued and checked over by a vet. Went exploring a bit more and in another room I found a bunch of dogs, all pretty friendly thankfully and looking healthy. Then in another room I found a mixed bunch of cats and dogs with some rabbits in the mix, all very friendly and coexisting together peacefully and looking healthy. In this room there was also a good amount of those massive spiders on the wall. Very bizarre and has left me a bit confused"

When I woke up, I did not know if it actually occurred or was just a dream. At one point during the dream I became self aware that I was dreaming and I wanted it to keep going as long as possible. However I had no control over what was happening in the dream, everything kept going and I just went along with it. So in this dream, I was myself as I am (20f) and I was the girlfriend of a famous singer (20m). I wont say who he is because none of you will know who he is and also its not really relevant. Now something about this singer, he‚Äôs the complete opposite of me and when they say opposites attract I used to never believe in that kind of stuff but for some time now I have been attracted to him like if he was a literal magnet. I am completely mesmerized. Because I am fascinated by his personality and lately I have learned a lot about myself even if it‚Äôs just from having on a crush on this guy. In the dream, it was the night of his concert, and I felt amazing. Let me tell you something about myself: I am very shy, serious, not the type to even enjoy a concert, but here in my dream I was having the time of my life! I felt safe and secure despite being in a large crowd. I felt an overwhelming amount of confidence which I have never experienced in real life. Then the singer (my boyfriend in my dream) took me backstage. And basically I just felt completely in love with him and he was obsessed and in love with me as well?!Again, this guy is very different from anyone I have ever felt interest in real life. And it‚Äôs not just because he‚Äôs famous or whatever, it‚Äôs because of his personality: his carefree laidback attitude, his ability to make friends easily, and the way he‚Äôs relaxed and easygoing about life is polar opposite from me. The dream ended when I began to realize I was dreaming. It ended off by him bringing me onto stage with him and introducing me to the crowd as his girlfriend. The crowd went wild and began screaming in excitement. And that‚Äôs the end. So can someone help me understand what this means?! I‚Äôm a girl who just stays at home reading books and never goes out at all, and suddenly I have the most intense realistic dream of my entire life where I am a rockstar‚Äôs girlfriend? Help Lol"

This made him cry which made me feel extremely guilty because I‚Äôve only ever seen my dad cry once. \n\nReal life: all day yesterday I just felt off &amp; that dream really freaked me out. Later on in the day I found out that my dog had broken his shoulder &amp; had osteocarcinoma that was making his bones brittle &amp; we decided to put him down. We knew this day was coming, but it freaked me out that it had happened that day after the dream. I also saw my dad cry for the second time in my life."

    "body": "I was in that vaguely familiar dreamspace with elements of my life, furniture and articles from my past etc. I was sitting on a barstool at a bar my dad built in our basement when I was a kid. A woman enters through a doorway, wearing a teal dress of intricate design and patterns, shiny with inlaid gems of blue, and takes a seat next to me. She holds out her hand and tells me to take it. I oblige and after a few seconds she asks if I could feel anything yet, and as I say no I felt our connection vibrate and glow blue and suddenly I am somewhere pitch black and confused. I feel a terrible presence enter and I crumble to the ground, trembling, and too afraid to look. I felt dirtier than ever before, and he chides me and tells me how minuscule and pathetic I looked. He said LOOK AT YOU, ARE YOU A COWARD? Pushing past the fear I muster \"I'm not a coward, I'm A FUCKING WARRIOR!\" And he says THEN GET UP AND START ACTING LIKE ONE! And I leapt up to my feet and bellowed a terrible roar as if to challenge heaven itself, my body ripped and muscles and veins bulging and a readiness to tear evil limb from limb. I realize no one is there, and I fade from that state of consciousness. I awaken on my back yet off the ground somewhere outside, a medium sized tree in the background, but I was surrounded by several figures. I didn't move. Only one of the figures looked human, like the ideal form of man but seemingly made of concrete. He wore a skull cap and trousers and a slight smirk. The rest I can hardly describe, but two of them in front of me looked vaguely humanoid, one had one eye and one had too many. They all held jars in their hands at center height. I start to fade out again as the figures close in around me with their jars and sticking my limbs in them and then I wake up on the barstool again next to the woman. She tells me I did well and I ask her who the statue man was, she said that was Adam. Then I woke up.\n\nHappened about a week before a beloved pet of mine died that helped pull me out of a downspiral, war experience had taken a toll on my humanity but he reminded me of just how human I still was. I took it better than I feared and expected. I only told my wife and a couple of friends, one was understanding and helpful  and one I think was weirded out and I lost contact with. Seems pretty straight forward but I figure I'd share it and see if anyone's had similar experiences or comments. Thanks for reading!"

    "body": "I had a very long dream last night which left me kind of speechless. Would appreciate any ideas concerning meaning and interpretations. \n- - -\nI was in my old school in performing school play. Filling in for someone who was sick. When it came time to perform I knew not where to go and where to be, making a complete fool of myself - I did not realize we were performing that day! After a brief interval I decide to make a better effort. I go out to take my seat for this lottery scene, as I do someone comes to me and says there is a bomb on stage. \n\nI take my place finding a jacket with my name on it. A woman leans over and starts to speak into a hidden tape recorder of the various items she finds and suspects might be linked to the bomb. But she forgets we are still onstage and so we both must pretend it‚Äôs part of the play. At this moment I open this letter on the table. This igniter slips from the letter and flies forward toward a book with a magnet. It starts glowing red. And I realize I‚Äôve activated the bomb. \nI stand up. Flip the table throwing the bomb away and yell ‚Äúrun‚Äù. I run for the door. People don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. A few moments later people exit the theatre, the ambulance and police arrive. The bomb went off and ten people died. \n\nAfterwards I am felt with guilt. As I caused the death of these ten people by throwing the bomb away. As I am looking out the window I see these three men seated together outside. I can see on their faces that they are my enemies, they have something against me. I realise then that these men were the ones who carried out the bombing. A few moments later the police let them go and they escape."

    "body": "So to start off, I‚Äôm a 30-something male married to a 30-something female. I hardly ever remember my dreams. Like, ever. That‚Äôs why this is strange to me that I remember this one. In fact, during the dream, it felt so much like reality that when I woke up, I thought that I was dreaming.\n\nI‚Äôm not particularly proud of the dream, although I‚Äôm very curious of its meaning.\n\nThe dream: \nI don‚Äôt remember much about the setting now, the colors, etc. but I recall there being two sofas in a room. The room was relatively small, I‚Äôm thinking maybe 12-14 foot wide by 20 foot long, can‚Äôt remember the height though I feel like the ceilings were low. The space felt sort of cozy. On one of the sofas was my wife, alone‚Ä¶ she may have been sleeping there, can‚Äôt recall. On the other sofa was me and another female. I don‚Äôt recall a face (other than thinking she was gorgeous) or a name. The only thing I really remember is that she had tattoos that were very deep in meaning to her. One I was so intrigued about was on her upper chest. I can‚Äôt remember the subject matter in the tattoo now but I do remember that it was rectangle in shape and the subject matter existed inside of the rectangle. I almost feel like it was a cup or a kettle on a stove. I do remember the other tattoo, it was on her right hand and wrist, like ocean coral and shells. It was vibrant and detailed. I can recall a feeling in the dream. Like this other female was an acquaintance but we both felt something for each other while feeling like I was trying to be discreet about that with my wife directly across from us. I don‚Äôt recall doing anything necessarily inappropriate other than sitting extremely close. \n\nFurther context: I will admit, I‚Äôve felt lonely for a while now. My wife doesn‚Äôt come to bed with me and when she does, she never sleeps close to me or really acknowledges that I exist there. Sometimes I wake up when she‚Äôs getting into bed but I‚Äôll lay there with my eyes closed to see if she acknowledges me at all‚Ä¶ and no, she just lays there, turned the other way on her cellphone. She‚Äôs usually good otherwise, taking care of the kids, the house‚Ä¶ we have fun together, but it feels more like a roommate dynamic (even with our children) now rather than a marriage.\n\nCan anyone help to decipher this dream in some way? I probably wouldn‚Äôt really care if I remembered more of my dreams. I just find it quite odd that this is one I do remember. Thank you."

    "body": "First post here, i am a 24 years old male, kinda introvert, there was something bugging me from years,since i have 7 years if i remember correctly, almost all my dreams take place in a Floating continent in Darkness, 3 times the size of earth,since i was little a LOT of my dreams takes place here, and is easy to know, because everytime i see the sky in my dream world is always black devoid of stars,there are only 2 smalls suns, a huge moon with a missing part in it,and a weird Red Star or glow in the darkness that only appear around  middle night, and if you get outside while the red star is glowing a lot of horrible creatures that looks like shadows from afar will appear all around the place,and it last for a hour if someone is outside,if all the people are inside buildings, the star will glow for 1 minute and disappear,so is safe to hide when that happens,describing my dream world perfectly is hard, because there is still a lot of places that i dont have reached yet, a simple description is a huge mass of land with a really tall spike mountains in the center, there are forest,plains,caves,swamps,deserts and really cold places, in the center,where the mountain is,there is a huge city in there,in one of my dreams i remember entering the capitol and there being a huge map of the world in there,a lot of places are unknown, there are varius cities and villages, and ruins too in the south east there is a village where you can reach a ocean,but the ocean from my dream world is weird,cause is alive,not like alive with fish and plants, the ocean itself is a sentient being, it will move around the continent from time to time,so the people living there settled around places were it tends to stop for at least 2 days, is full of life too, there are fish plants and the like but there is not ocean floor,only the void from below the continent. it can get agressive too if people hunt to much fish from it or when the red star is shining, so it will tend to destroy villages close to the cliff borders of the continent. the days are kinda normal,the sky is black but there is light from the suns,clouds and rains.but like in the earth where the atmosfere is blue that dont happen there,about the era of civilization is weird, some cities are modern,some are from the past, and there are no airplanes, or methods to travel in the sky, only cars,horses or being in the ocean when is moving around the continent. in one of the cities around north there is a huge bridge,is really long and big,people can cross it without problem, i have seen another continent in the other side,but i cant cross it,i have died already 3 times trying crossing it,the first i was shot by a robber,i could feel my blood flowing from my wound and the loss of my senses, when i died that time i was only 11 years old, so i got really scare,another time i was crossing in a car and around halfway the bridge huge shadow arms came from below the bridge and pushed me and others cars to the void, other time i tried again and before reaching on foot halfway the bridge the red star appeared and i got killed by the monsters, it was not painful lucky me,but up close they are hideous,they where decaying and not humanoid like,they where a deformity if you could say. after dying 3 times crossing i havent tried anymore,or at least,any more dreams close to that bridge havent appear anymore. i have die more times but in other places, one place is a part where there is a crater and inside that crater is a forest,in the middle is a lake with a perpetual tornado in it, i think i was around 8 years old when in a dream i died there,i could feel the tornado picking me up and throwing me really far away and before i crashed to the ground i woke up sweating.i remember a small urban zone in the top of the crater with grave holes empty and various persons around,they didnt say anything about the empty graves. in the city there are always a lot of persons,persons that i dont know or have seen in my life,they can talk,interact and have feelings,but when i ask about the other continent or about the weird red star they get dead silent and the surrounding too,they stop blinking and it gets creepy and unconfortable,so i tend to leave or change the topic quickly. is a extensive place, i dare say that i have explored only 10 or 20% of that place,and mostly cities,villages,forest or ruins.some ruins give me a bad vibe and a feeling that i should leave,one of the most impactful ruins i visited was a long passage around 2 cliff that was dark,in the wall there where various statues of persons really huge,they all where without head,only bodies,and they where tall like a 5 floor high building, in the end of the passage there was a big stone wall with bones and a broken door, inside that area there was thousands of giants bone arms reaching the sky from the ground, there was a heavy fog around and i got a feeling that i was being observed,in the middle there was something behind the fog that was looking me, i got chills and gose pumps around my body and something was telling me inside to run, so i did and in the passage i hear a creepy and chilly scream coming from there that woke me up scared and crying, it was around  when i was 10 or so  it gived me a scare.there is even more but it would be really long, what i want to know is,why i cant cross that bridge,and why the place is that weird?. oh and about the dreams that dont hapen in that place,they happen in earth and tends to be really cosmic like."

The ship was deep into the sea when a tidal wave came and knocked the ship over. I was inside in my room when all this happened, but I had an aerial view of the disaster.\n\nI hit my head I fainted. It must‚Äôve been days later when I woke up. I could tell that I was deep deep in the ocean. I‚Äôve always been kind of a loner, so, when I got out of my cabin and looked everywhere, no one was there. The first few floors were completely flooded. I had no way to get out even if I wanted to. If I could get out where would I go? Even if I had special equipment, I doubt I would be able to make it. The pressure of the water would probably kill me first. Then it would likely be the nitrate bubbles from swimming upwards too fast. Even if I somehow made it up to the surface alright, I‚Äôd be lost in the middle of the sea. So I had no choice but just wait. I ate the food that was still okay to eat. \n\nI think I passed down in the dream. Because in the later parts, I had a swim outside the ship and get some food that was just outside. I work at a Bakery in real life and that‚Äôs the food that was there. Cakes and croissants that are just looking nasty from being underwater but I had to get them. One of the head chef‚Äôs for my job was there helping me."

I ran into my parents there for some odd reason. This old but fashionable woman that I didn‚Äôt know approached me and complimented a fur coat I was wearing. I said thank you. Later I went back to my room to discover that the door was open. The old woman came out carrying another coat of mine, and offered to trade this fur vest in exchange for the other coat. I told her that I didn‚Äôt want the vest but she could just have the coat anyway since I didn‚Äôt really like it anyway. Throughout the beginning of the dream she kinda just kept popping up where I was and being super kind to me. Later I was just hanging in my hotel room and checked my bank balance and it was less than I‚Äôd thought but the statements were consistent with where I‚Äôd been so I figured I‚Äôd just spent more than I thought. My card was still in my wallet. I checked again later and my balance just kept dropping and dropping. I tried to freeze my account but my bank app kept loading. It felt like those dreams where you‚Äôre trying to run but it feels like you‚Äôre running through molasses. And I kept trying to freeze it just watching the balance drop not knowing what to do. I called the police but they told me I‚Äôd never get my money back even if I pressed charges.

My friend is there and we get in there together in this big hall. (At this point it‚Äôll get even more random guys) Things went fine for a while until there‚Äôs one guy looks kinda nerdy try to steal stuff from my friends like pickpocket something like that.

Sure enough, it starts to make me float and I begin to protect myself by repeatedly saying ‚ÄúI am divinely protected‚Äù, but this entity is trying to silence me by muffling my words, and I have fight to speak and get the words out. I can feel that I am physically restrained when trying to speak too. I have to fight, and sincerely resist this force and cannot be overtaken by it.\n\nThis time, however I‚Äôm adding in the lines ‚ÄúI banish you back to hell from whence you came‚Äù ‚Äúbe gone‚Äù, and I recall the entity gets forced down a hall and into room, where the door shuts. I am still floating by force, and it seems another entity has showed up.\n\nI turned my attention to it and I keep doing the same thing‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve forgotten how it ends but I woke up.\n\n\nThe first time I had this dream of being forced into the air and was floating, it took place in some attic with high, vaulted ceilings, and the entity looked to be cloaked in black and was also floating. I had only been in that attic dreamscape once before, first time no entity present, and sometimes I go back to it and realize it‚Äôs not a good place to be &amp; will wake myself up.\n\nThe forced floating sensation, and being unable to speak feels real, I feel I am physically resisting something.\n\nBut yeah, I keep having these dreams and this last one was far more intense and too close of an interaction for my comfort. \n\nI am not a member of an organized religion, and this entity seems like it may be part of one."

I‚Äôve tried psychedelics, DMT, etc. They came very close, but the elements are still found solely in my dreams. The feelings‚Ä¶ are simply indescribable. But they show that reality is halved and repressed.   \n\nSome of the only ways I can describe them, a sense filled me, I knew what was happening, it was so devastating and beautiful; I was being destroyed and reminded - all that was familiar, all reference points, all identity -- all viciously shattered and reformed in moments. I can‚Äôt even recognize the feelings, they‚Äôre unrecognizable - just a momentary glimpse of the other side, of the other feelings.  \n\nSo extreme and vivid, in one dream, on a roof on a building, again, reality is morphed, but still recognizable. I was with someone, it wasn‚Äôt love. The feeling, of everything. How our sociality confounded itself in this dream, how it linked together, the epitome - essence of it, you could feel it. So beautiful. They and I‚Ä¶ we knew each other. The aftertaste is so beautiful and vivid. So entrancing and consuming, it absorbs me with each phase of thought and every note. So inexplicable. I find myself enslaved but it, like a cleansing rain it washes over the me, this indescribable feeling. the most INTENSE feeling on this planet. I can taste the aftertaste, the glimpses are so beautiful, before it becomes lost to a black void I can only barely remember.  \n\nThe feelings, of equilibrium like in some of my dreams, in some dreams, it‚Äôs the strongest ever, Very vivid. The environment and it‚Äôs entirety plotted out in semblances of quintessence. The aftertaste lying in bed is one of the best feelings ever. When I woke up, I felt a longing, a desire for something that isn't possible. It‚Äôs so ecstatic. I felt a strange euphoria and happiness. I could taste the afterthought of the emotion, but couldn't connect it to an existing physical meaning like with normal emotions.  \n\nEvery second of my life I spend longing for the dreams, I oversleep so often, just hoping that the feelings return. I cry everyday‚Ä¶ the feelings are so powerful."

The size of my room was much bigger then it actually is. Kinda like as if I was a toy in Toy Story. In the dream there were these vaudeville cartoons throughout the room. They were angry and distorted though. It was kinda like if you were to have a bad trip on acid. In the dream I was trying to figure out how to get out of the room. If I failed, the dream restarted. There was a point where I lucidly realized I need to wake up. But I didn‚Äôt wake up after many attempts. After that realization, lucidly I told myself I died in my sleep and woke up in hell. I started feeling my pulse getting faster and became more frantic in my efforts to wake up. I eventually woke up actually and felt my pulse because I was curious. It was very fast. Anyone have interpretations?"

    "body": "I don't typically have vivid dreams, but this one stuck with me all day, enough to prompt me to post here to see what people think.\n\nIt started out with my husband and I just going about our normal day. We got a call from one of our friends (who it was is unknown, but the feeling was \"friend\") who let us know they had a dream that the world was about to end. \n\nWe looked online to see if there was anything going on, and basically there was a sudden countdown timer for, like, 5 minutes until doomsday. There wasn't any specific event that was predicted, just The End and everyone would die. \n\nI went through all the stages of grief in my dream in a very short time and before we knew it, my husband I were just holding each other waiting for The End (or not). I didnt think it would happen until my consciousness saw a massive red dust wave just whoosh across the planet (i was omniscient for a moment) in about 4 seconds, then i saw it over his shoulder coming for us, and then it was all black. \n\nThe next thing that happened is I was a thought, all encompassing, in the cosmos. I had no body, no form, just consciousness. I spoke to my husband there and also everyone else on earth who had died- we were all one with private conversations happening simultaneously. We thought, \"hey, this isn't so bad!\" Until a giant blackhole opened in the heart of the very universe itself and the universe started imploding. \n\nWe all watched as planets, stars, images of war, memes, ideas, everything material and not material that we know (but was MADE into an image being sucked in, it had a physical symbol, if that makes sense) was destroyed until the edges of the universe closed in on us like a pool of water going down a drain. \n\nNothingness. But obviously, I didn't know because I wasn't there. Next thing that happened, I woke up next to my husband and a similar day replayed- but I had given him a trinket during the 5 minute doomsday countdown, and he still had it with him so we remembered everything that had just happened and it was over. \n\nMy initial thoughts are stress, but I FELT so high, so free, so powerful being in the cosmos. It was a physical feeling in my body of just lightness. And the reborn, the symbolism, the trinket- it seems a bit deeper to me. \n\nThank you in advance!"

I remembered then not replying to the message. about a few bit later (roughly 10-15-20-30 minutes) he sends me a photo of him and her in bed half naked, her laying with her legs bent and on his right ride with the blanket draped over her body, the same blanket that i have. \n\nthank you so much for reading, i really hope i can find out the meaning of this dream."

In the dream, it kept trying to bite me. Eventually, the rattlesnake's head was separated from its body. I think I might've had some type of sword/knife/stick that I was using to defend myself, and I may have slashed its head off in the dream, but I don't remember that happening. \n\nI continued to dream that, after I did this, the snake's body continued to lunge at me. The head, separate from the body, also kept moving toward me, somehow moving in a slithering motion, but also bouncing at times. I don't remember if I dreamt it bit me-- I believe in the dream that it either did, or came close. It kept flashing its fangs at me threateningly.\n\nSome context-- I'm a 26-year old male in a graduate program. Recently, I've been struggling after a friend of mine took their own life about a month ago. I wonder if the dream has anything to do with that. Another important piece of context is that I'm not really afraid of snakes. I'm terrified of spiders and scorpions, but I've always been fascinated by snakes (except for the gross muscle-y constrictor snakes) and don't have any type of phobia of them."

They were all running down the hallway but they weren't able to move past a certain point. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAfter a getting shot at a few more times, I picked up a fire extinguisher and used it to block a bullet before throwing at her.

    "body": "I‚Äôm not even sure what the best word to describe it is so I‚Äôll just give as much detail as I can and hopefully it makes sense.\n\nThe dream started with me in a room beside a basement (a bedroom not unlike my brother used to have)\n\nAnd basically I was asked not to leave that room.\n\nBut quickly I found myself tormenting by some demonic force that was doing weird things like making faces on the walls and making it appear the door was gone so I couldn‚Äôt leave.\n\nThe details don‚Äôt matter but just keep in mind I was being tormented by this demonic force and it scared me enough I really didn‚Äôt want it to happen again.\n\nBecause that becomes important later.\n\nSuddenly the dream cuts to me sitting side by side with a woman I‚Äôve known since middle school. One of my closest friends and someone I‚Äôve always loved.\n\nSomehow I instinctually knew that on some spiritual level we were (for a lack of a better term) both drawing the same energy.\n\nIf life was some magnetic axis, she and I are both north (or both south)\n\nBoth Yin or both Yang.\n\nAnd for this reason I knew that the two of us being together meant we were drawing in the same type of energy, making it positive, and the demonic force could never return because of this.\n\nThink of it like we‚Äôre slowly building up our ‚Äúki‚Äù and it‚Äôs acting like a force field.\n\nBut not just for stopping evil things but it felt like luck in general.\n\nLike somehow I knew my chances of random bad things happening like stubbing my toe or a tire blowing out all the way up to heart attacks would be lower\n\nAnd random good things like stumbling across a winning lottery ticket would be higher.\n\nI went to pay her some platonic compliment and I felt she took it the wrong way because she responded ‚ÄúI just need more time‚Äù as if she just recently divorced or lost her husband.\n\nAt this point the dream cuts to me walking into the house of a blonde girl that looks like a movie star I‚Äôve always admired, and when she looked her best too.\n\nShe took my hand and introduced me as her boyfriend which thrilled me.\n\nBut then it‚Äôs like a silent narrator just telepathically told me that despite how good she is (physically, mentally, emotionally) something about her (in an almost horoscope bullshit sort of way) meant she was on the other axis.\n\nNot even just neutral but one that would be negative and drain all that good juju I had built up earlier.\n\nRight then I knew if I stayed with her it would be constant misfortune. No chance at the lottery , if anything I‚Äôd get robbed randomly and lose money.\n\nNot because she‚Äôs bad in any way (I can‚Äôt emphasize that enough) but because she just brought bad luck.\n\nSo she tried to lead me up stairs , a moment I‚Äôve probably wished would happen with this actress in dreams for years but all I could think about was that the demon from earlier would pop out at any moment now.\n\nMy protection was gone and would soon become anti-protection (like a beacon for bad things)\n\nBut I wanted to stay with her anyway. \n\nAs I type this the meaning seems almost too obvious. The first girl is the right girl. But can it really be that simple?"

Rather than feeling threatened, I felt comfortable and safe instead. I was much older there, around mid-20s. Same for the man who seemed to be in his late 20s. There were stalls at the side and there are some people selling various things like the ones you can see when you go to a night market. Both of us were wearing pants and shirts and he has a clean cut of hair. I had a long straight hair there, my curly hair is inborn.\n\nAnd then, while we were walking, we were just looking around, sight-seeing, having smiles on our lips while enjoying the surroundings. After some minutes, we finally arrived at the destination. It was at the countryside and there was a house made of wood and cement there. The house is built under a huge tree and at the side, you can see the rice fields. \n\nWe went inside the house. It is actually fully furnished but it looked like it was being abandoned after a celebration. You can see the food sitting on the table, untouched. You can see confetti on the floor, the balloons, the decorations still hanged up on the walls. And then, we went inside a certain room and we saw a bunch of baby items like blankets, clothes, etc. In every clothing there, the baby's name is embroidered.

I literally have no complaints whatsoever.\n\nWell.... but there was this dream. In my dream, I found out that my partner had been hiding some crucial information under her bed. I opened her laptop and took a look at some documents. I saw pictures of at least two women that she had killed by drugging them up. The pictures themselves weren't disturbing or violent, they were just normal ID pictures. But there were pills attached to the pictures (inside of little plastic bags) and I just KNEW that they were her victims.\nNext thing I see is my partner entering the room and I pretended to not have seen anything.\nI knew that she was planning to do the same with me eventually. It was her method of killing people: By entering relationships with them and making them feel safe and loved, not thinking anything bad of it all. \n\nI felt so disappointed and betrayed and also fearful..... when I woke up, I couldn't remember the dream at first, but then it hit me.

Now I can‚Äôt remember ever seeing what the front of the pendant looked like, I just remember holding it up to others and seeing the back of it, getting an idea of what it looked like. But I have more of a feeling that the pendant was some kind of green color, and it had metal swirls around it, the pendant itself was circular. Now nothing ever happened to me when I held it, but I felt like I had to be it‚Äôs protector, it‚Äôs keeper, because I‚Äôm the hands of everyone else it gave off a really bad vibe of like evil, or angry energy coming off of it. When it was in the hands of those who touched it though, their faces kind of distorted. They went to like a weird shape and than back to a whole new constructed face. They didn‚Äôt look bad or anything, just unrecognizable and like they‚Äôre someone completely new. I‚Äôm the end of this dream I ripped the pendant out of someone‚Äôs hand and kept it myself and said I was gonna take the pendant and put it up in a clear frame, because of the energy the pendant was letting off. I dont know exactly what this dream was trying to communicate, but I know that something is trying to be told to me. When I dream all the time, I write down a lot of things and interpret different parts of my dreams and connect them all together to get to the bottom of the message."

    "body": "Last night I dreamt about being in a place that I‚Äôve dreamt of before, though it was quite a bit different than the last time I dreamt of it. It was a place that I knew to be a really big school with a lay-out too confusing for myself to know go to get around, so it was easy to get lost/lose my bearings. The first time I‚Äôve dreamt of the school, it was a good dream.\n\nAlthough it was a school and had classrooms and a lunch room, it also had multiple different apartment buildings in it. Each apartment had a different lay-out as well as having two ways to get in and out, each leading to a hallway with multiple doors leading to more apartments, or different school rooms. There WAS a way to eventually get outside, but at one outside area you needed a vehicle to bring out out and at another side it was completely fenced in. \n\nThere was a set of twins (male and female), each having their own sword. Their purpose of being there was to protect everyone. \nMy boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) were in a lunchroom, and he grabbed a couple of beverages out of the vending machine and drank them before leaving - I grabbed one beverage out of the vending machine, and before I could open it, the lights went out. \n\n(This next part starts to get kind of graphic, so possible TW)\nI used my phone for a flashlight and found my way out of the room into the hallway and then into an apartment-style room. There I saw the two twins and some other people, but something was corrupting the twins. The twins exchanged their swords with one another and started crying blood before cutting the side of the other‚Äôs neck just enough to bleed. Immediately after, the twins started killing everyone in the room - I was in a bit of shock, but then left the room to run into a different room.\n\nI could hear the door to the room the twins were in open and then close, so I kept running to find the door in the room to bring me into the next one away from them. It was also at this point that I somehow knew that my 5yo son was around somewhere as well, so I was also running to try and find him. \n\nThere was one room I ran into but couldn‚Äôt find the way out of the other side of it, so I hid in a closet. The twins came into the room, and while looking in the bathroom I ran out to a different one. I eventually ran into someone else that was hiding in a closet with my son - he was so terrified that he couldn‚Äôt make a sound but he looked like he was trying to scream - I think he thought I might have been the twins until he realized that it was me instead. \n\nUpon the realization, he clung to me. The woman that was hiding with him said she had found him hiding under a super low shelf - I then asked her if it was super obvious that he was hiding there and she said that she didn‚Äôt realize he was there until he came out once he realized that t was a safe person. I was relieved upon hearing that.\n\nWe knew that we had to keep going to stay ahead of the twins, so we looked for the other door that would lead out. I noticed in the closet there was a little bit of a platform higher up, so. Lifted my son up there, but he was scared saying ‚Äúno, no, no‚Äù - I reassured him we were all going to go together, but that he had to go first and I would follow and the seemed to do the trick.\n\nI went up next, and then the other woman followed. I realized there were dim lights on that we could not turn off and I was worried that we would be found from that alone if we stayed, so I looked around and noticed the closet went further down (but only in this upper part) and that there was a door on the other side. We all went through to find ourselves in another room. We went through quite a few more rooms before coming across one with a lot of other people inside. \n\nEveryone here seemed to be under the impression that they were safe, so they had music playing very loud and were hanging around like there wasn‚Äôt any danger lurking. I put my son up into the top of the closet as it had a deep upper part that went further than the  closet itself before going down and unplugging the music and telling them they were endangering everyone there. They told me to stfu and that they were fine, and then plugged the music back in. \n\nI went into the top of the closet but did not see my son - he was down below looking for me, so I grabbed him and brought him up with me. We then hid in the super far back near the door to the next room. Someone was pacing back and forth in that room, and I woke up as I was going to go through the door to talk to them."

    "body": "Last night, a portion of my dream was devoted to being cut in half.\n\nIf anyone is familiar with the series Chainsaw Man, I was taking the place of the main character Denji. I was running away from a threat with some allies in a metropolitan setting. The threat appeared to be a fairly normal looking young adult woman who appeared to have gone wild and enraged from stress. Her demeanor kind of matched how I've been wanting to vent my anger and frustration internally after how the last couple of years have left me feeling unfulfilled and completely alienated. I can place anger towards others, but I cannot place blame on them or myself for what has happened. I can't hate anyone over it.\n\nThe only thing abnormal about this woman was the immense strength she used with a knife to gruesomely cut diagonally through my torso and right arm, right on through to the person on my left as well. Both of us went down and I was very aware of the fact that my legs were no longer attached to my body.\n\nIn the moment, I was taking in how rough the wounds felt. The woman had mounted over my body to impale me a few, slow times. Despite this, I felt very calm and I did not actually feel in danger at all. It didn't feel like murder. My head on its side against cobblestone could look up to see the woman with a quivering expression of wild anger. Tears rolled down her cheeks, her eyes trying not to cry themselves shut. Strained giggles escaped her between sobs.\n\nI only really sensed a budding empathy for her. As the dream started to wrap up, I felt mostly calm and safe. I knew that in a dream, it was a safe space for these ugly emotions to come out. Though really, I don't got much of my own ideas for why I was cut in half, and I am curious to know what others think of this."

He said we had to get the kids together and that my MIL was coming over. We had 2 kids with a 3rd on the way. It was so weird to me because I remember so vividly what everyone looked like, the number of light switches by our shared bed (3 on my side, 3 on his), the color of the clothes I was wearing down to the art in the house. I remember what my MIL &amp; my FIL looked like down to their shoes. The conversations that were had, everything. My husband left to go to the store and was in an accident when my FIL showed up to tell me we had to talk about the kids, but that everything was okay and my husband would be back.

Currently in many categories of my life (health, finances, emotional health etc.) there have been things I have been trying to pursue and I feel like I'm a bit lost and unsure of the proper paths to take for the outcomes I'm trying to achieve. Could he mean that I actually am on the right path and to just trust in that? But why would he call it the 'map' and not the 'way' if that's the case?

She and I still get physical sometimes (she says her husband is okay with it) and will even pretend to be girlfriends, so sometimes it feels like our relationship and feelings are deeper than \"just friends\".*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn my dream, I was hanging out with my ex at her house and a few random girls we had met at the bar (not girls I know in real life, my brain just made them up). I remember feeling left out and not included for most of the time. She was flirting with these girls and playing with their hair, letting them lay on her, etc. (all stuff that she typically does with me in real life). At one point, my ex asked me to go outside and get something for her (I don't remember what it was), but I went outside and it was dark because it was nighttime. I was looking for the thing she wanted me to get and I came across this snake. It was huge, mostly light green with some large black diamond shapes on it and [looked like this](https://br.pinterest.com/pin/682295412270638671/). Not sure what it actually was, but I knew for a fact it wasn't a local species where I live (Midwest U.S.) I didn't see it at first and startled it, so it hissed at me and started standing up. I backed away and told the snake, \"I'm really sorry, I didn't see you there\" and then it left me alone.\n\nThen, one of my ex's neighbors came over to me and asked me if I wanted him to kill the snake for me. Again, this isn't someone I know, my brain just made him up. I told him no and it was fine, the snake wasn't bothering me anymore and I had just startled it. I kept looking for whatever it was I supposed to be getting, and I found a second snake. This one was a lot smaller, with a brownish-red banding pattern. I'm not sure if it was a local species, but it definitely looked a lot less exotic, [sort of like this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/73683441@N07/16795702747). This time I didn't startle the snake, so we made eye contact but left each other alone and I moved on to keep looking.\n\nAfter that, this big animal that resembled a panda bear came up to me and started nibbling on my hand and grabbed onto me. It was really friendly, but it was very clingy and latched on to me with its arms and would not let go. I remember thinking that it must have been a baby that had lost its mom. I was trying to look it up on my phone to found out what type of animal it was. While I was doing that, my ex came outside to see what was taking me so long and to make sure I was okay. I told her everything that had happened and when I got done explaining, I noticed that the panda-like animal was gone. I also tried to show her the snakes, but I found them both dead on the ground tied up against a spear. The neighbor said he killed them because they were dangerous, but then I got very upset and told him that they weren't bothering anyone, this was their home too, and they didn't deserve to die. After that, my ex and I spent the rest of the dream trying to find the panda-like animal because I wanted to save it."

So I want to know what this might mean.\n\nIn the dream I was standing in front of my uncle and his fianc√©s house. Now, this doesn‚Äôt seem too weird, but I haven‚Äôt seen them in ages yet their house was fully detailed in the dream. Another thing I noticed was that everything seemed to be 90‚Äôs themed. The cars, houses, decorations, the whole vibe of the dream. \n\nI was waiting in front off their garden when I (in the dream) remembers someone telling me to not take the medicine. I‚Äôm confused as I stand there when a car pulls up beside me. The people inside are having fun and laughing as the driver offers me a packet of prescribed medication. I decline but they continue to insist until the car I‚Äôm waiting for arrives. The others drive off. \n\nThe person?, that earlier told me not to take the medicine tells me that my ‚Äústep cousin‚Äù is taking the medicine. I get into the car that is supposed to take me to my soccer game. (I haven‚Äôt played soccer for over two years now.) Anyway we make small talk in the car when the stranger that sit beside me offers me another package of the same prescribed medication. I tell her off but she continues to insist and tells me that it‚Äôs much better and healthier to take. That it will make me feel much better. A warning flag goes off in my head and I ignore her for the rest off the ride. The driver which is someone I know (not in real life, idk who that was) then proceeds to take a wrong turn and drives to a nearby health centre.\n\nI‚Äôm confused but follows the others inside. In the centre everyone is working and the driver guide me to an office while she talks about how good and necessary the medication is. She then tells me that she‚Äôs almost finished with making the medication legal. She then offers me some of the pills. I ask to read the labels but she just laugh at my question. She then tells me to either take the pills or I will get the medicine injected. I start panicking and ask her about the soccer game. She tells me that we will go there when I take the medication. \n\nI try to look for an exit but she just laughs and yet again tells me to take the medication. She then leans down to my ear and tells me that the pills are much, much better than the injections. And that only fools take the injections. She then hands me the packet of pills. The dreams end shortly after."

I was walking along some kind of water, not sure if it was a lake, or river. I remember seeing a lot of snakes. Then we (my boyfriend and I) came upon my dog and a either a crocodile or alligator. They had my dogs leg in their mouth when I approached it it released my dog and my boyfriend tried to come behind it and grab my dog out of harms way but it turned around and grabbed my dogs leg again. It had to be shot a few time before it released my dog. We scooped up my dog and tried to rinse blood from him so I could see how bad his injuries were. Both his front legs had about half of his fur gone. Then I noticed the bite may have gotten an artery in his arm because the blood wouldn‚Äôt stop.

And I‚Äôm pretty sure I was in Louisiana even though I‚Äôve never actively been in Louisiana. (I‚Äôve passed through Louisiana once.) I noticed that the trolley lines were intersecting with the regular vehicle lanes, and there were stoplights. \nThe first stoplight, I realized I was breaking too hard and not in time enough and I told myself that I need to pay attention. At the second light, my passenger side got hit with a trolley. I have a very little car IRL but the trolley was more damaged than my vehicle. Before I get out of the car, I noticed that two black, older men were conducting it. One was drinking out of a Bud Light beer can and the other man was smoking a joint. And I asked myself if my insurance good so I started freaking out and trying to find anything to use against the conductors like smoking weed and drinking alcohol while driving the trolley. So I got out and I called my mother and she‚Äôs not paying attention, she‚Äôs cutting me off, she can‚Äôt hear me, every excuse under the sun for her to explain to me at the bare minimum, that she could not grasp what I was trying to ask her. In the meantime, the two men that were conducting, it turned into two very attractive men. So attractive that I got nervous and embarrassed, even more so since I was blocking traffic.\nI got mad, I was scared, and I was trying to experience some intense back pain and started cursing at her and yelling at her, and so forth. And then she had my sister on the phone trying to fuss at me for it. \nI proceeded to tell my sister she‚Äôs the last person to start passing judgment, or pass any advice to anyone on how to do their life or be responsible. I guess we were on FaceTime and I saw that she had a newborn baby girl on her chest. I am a Santa Muerte Devotee, so I started praying to Her to let this be a dream.\n\nIRL: \nI woke up at exactly 0130, on the way to the bathroom I thanked Santa Muerte for letting that being just a dream.\n\nMy mom is not the best person to talk to in emergencies. And the relationship I have with my sister isn‚Äôt perfect (and even recently she tried to belittle me like we‚Äôre children again, even though we are 10 years apart and full grown adults), she has three boys I want to say the youngest is maybe three and she cannot have any more children. \n\nHelp."

    "body": "I am one to believe dreams have meanings but usually don‚Äôt often have nightmares or dreams that are disconcerting enough to care to find out what they mean. However I had a series of nightmares last night which weren‚Äôt entirely all that bad I think just due to a lack of vividness, though they were VERY out of the my dreaming norm and played out as a series of dreams all with the same unnerving theme.\n\nThroughout these dreams I found myself running from a sort of sinister evil or evil spirit that was hunting people down and killing them. The first dream involves me working at some unfamiliar store where people began to die spontaneously on shift but we were expected to stay. Remaining staff and I realized the cause was staring into the reflection of an old TV in the store because when doing so, intense fear and the feeling of an evil presence would wash over you. I don‚Äôt know why but I kept wanting to look into it to figure out exactly what it was and a feeling of impending doom grew each time until I finally sprinted out of the store and ran to my car and sped out of the parking lot like my life depended on it, feeling like if I wasn‚Äôt out of there fast enough, I was next.\n\nSimilar scenarios repeated in smaller dreams I had later on in the night where I kept finding myself wanting to investigate these very malevolent energies coming from reflections.  I think I wanted to investigate both out of curiosity and a hope that it would go away. One small dream involved me looking into the reflection of the sliding glass door in my kitchen and would feel waves of fear wash over me but nothing happened. Another dream didn‚Äôt involve a reflection I recall but involved me being in my house with a coworker of mine and sprinting outside to my car while desperately pleading with this coworker to come outside and get in the car with me all while they were confused and asking my why. One last related one involved my walking down the street past the store from the first dream to see if the evil energy was still there and killing the workers.\n\nFinally, this last one was a little different and didn‚Äôt feel scary to me in the moment but was very creepy and sinister in nature. I was in this very old dingy apartment that was very colorless and filled with dusty sunlight. There were a bunch of friendly but timid monsters living together on this floor I was on. They were all just lifelessly doing nothing while I was desperately searching all the rooms for something. They did not bother me until I opened a door that led to an attic above. As soon as I did all the monsters started fearfully and angrily screaming and yelling NOOO!!! NOO!!! And suddenly blood starts pouring down the stairs and I feel fear wash over me and I sprint outside and begin running from the apartment building. I look back and from a dormer window on the roof I see two creatures watching me, one large and one small- one white with large black voids for eyes and one black with large white voids for eyes. I run as fast as I can but they continue to watch me until finally from a third person perspective I watch my eyes melt out of my head and my body collapse to its knees. It felt like I turned into one of the monsters living in that place.\n\nI don't usually have dreams like this, let alone a series of them all night. I'm mostly unbothered about it but am also very curious what it all could mean if it does mean something. I'm at a relatively good place in life right now and have been doing good inner work so it's not something I would expect to be within me with this sudden intensity at this moment in time. What are your thoughts?"

So in the dream there is a 4-way rotary intersection with a central island and wide median strip on each way and my dad and I are standing on the left lane of the road whereas my mom and sister are taking the bus on the opposite lane. This is then the dream ends. I've had this same dream for many years when I was child. The intersection looked very beautiful and way too modern for that time.\n\nWhen I turned 18 or so (around year 2015) , I needed to go to a different city for some works with my dad. This is the city which is approximately 60 kms away and I had never been there. So I was driving the car and my dad was sitting on the passenger sit. The road network was in rectangular pattern and after crossing a few intersections, I was right at the same spot I used to get dreams of. It immediately clicked me that I'm on the same lane, and there is this bus coming on the opposite lane and that there is a median in between to separate the opposite traffic. Except that my mom and sister weren't there and they weren't taking the bus, it was me and my dad only there. \n\nBut everything I saw in those dreams happened right back at that time and at that intersection.

My brother was now trapped in the basement as the bear made its way towards me. \n\nI slammed another door in way face of the bear, for that door to also be knocked down. I grabbed the gun to try shooting again, only to be left hitting the bear upside the head with it. This stopped the bear for a minute. \n\nAfter I briefly delayed the attack by hitting the animal, it began coming towards me again. It stepped on top of one of the doors it busted down. As it did I reached down towards that door, lifted it up with the bear on it &amp; threw both the door &amp; the animal away from me. \n\nIt was at this moment the bear seemed to realize I was not going to give up this fight. We stood staring at each other in the house until I woke up sweating. \n\nI have my ideas on what this means. I‚Äôm interested in the thoughts of my fellow dream lovers too! Cheers!"

We then sat down and his friends arrived and started asking further questions, ‚Äúdo you like grain-fed, or grass-fed beef?‚Äù and the like. \n\nWe agree to come with them back to their house so they can cook us dinner but the closer we get back the more unease I feel, then boom, when we get through the door we‚Äôre immediately handcuffed and brought to the attic where we‚Äôre then tied to a pole. We sit for a bit and I talk her through how we need to leave and form an escape plan but she doesn‚Äôt agree and is only going along with it.\n\nI break free and we run outside, there‚Äôs a fence with a clear exit to the main road through an alley way so I run and jump it. I look back to get my girlfriend to jump too and she struggles but gets over. At this point I‚Äôm excited to be out but she stops and tells me no, we need to go back. I‚Äôm very confused because we were handcuffed in an attic, why would we go back? But she says that no they were in fact going to cook for us and I need to. I plead with her to just come with me because I just want to go home and be safe but she turns around and goes back in. \n\nAt this point I walk off and one of the guys comes out of the house chasing me. I run off shouting at him how he took me prisoner and that I‚Äôm not coming back but as I run I get slower and slower. He catches up but says I‚Äôm not worth it and heads home.\n\nI get back to my house and my friends ask me what happened and upset, I tell them. We then hear a knock on the door and I open it to see my girlfriend in nothing but a silk bathrobe with the guys from before all laughing and she throws a pair of scissor at me before I slam the door and she walks off. One of the guys was particularly brutish and tall, he sticks out the most.\n\nIf anyone could make sense of this one then it‚Äôll be much appreciated because I am confused af."

I suspected a male staff member had something to do with it but I wasn‚Äôt sure which one so I blamed one guy at a time. Every guy I blamed was fired. I was surprised. I didn‚Äôt realize my words had so much power. Then I found the perpetrator. I caught him on camera. I told the principal. She asked why I felt like I needed proof this time and I said because I plan to press charges.\n\nScene cut I‚Äôm in a break room of some kind. I notice that one of the male staff members that I got fired was there. He was someone I liked a lot and I did not mean to get him fired. I wanted him to notice me so I tried to look cute. \n\nHe ended up noticing me and came over. He said you‚Äôre really toxic you know that. You caused a lot of people to loose their jobs all because of your intuition. You come off so strong and crazy. And you know what I really freaking love that. I was trying so hard not to look at you but you are so cute I couldn‚Äôt help but come over here. \n\nIn my dream I was so happy that he still liked me and did not take my actions personally. Although they were extreme. \n\nThen before I woke up the scene cut again to me being an intern at a news station. They were trying to teach me how to be a news reporting journalist. My dreams often cut to me being an intern at a news station. I‚Äôm not sure why. At this point though my past dream felt like a memory.\n\nAt the news station I was doing my job. I was walking around helping to write news stories as well as weather scripts. Then I was approached by the head anchor. He stopped me and put his hand on my upper arm and said ‚Äú(My Name), I have been seeing you around here lately and I think you‚Äôre really great. Would you like to go get a cup of coffee after work?‚Äù I responded yes and said as long as it‚Äôs appropriate I don‚Äôt mind. He said it was appropriate and went to his chair to start his news cast. \n\nI‚Äôve had this dream multiple times and he would always pay close attention to me. I‚Äôd catch him watching me work sometimes. I figured that was the dream warning me to watch out for people watching me. Until I had this new dream last night. \nA little about the News Anchor; he was older than me, a different race, and he had a face you‚Äôd remember. His face was not always kind, which is why I assumed my other dreams were warnings. But when he touched me I felt like he had good loving intentions and couldn‚Äôt help but smile. \n\nMostly however when I dreamed of being a news station intern I payed very little attention to him and just enjoyed my dream. It was fun being an intern. \n\nOh and one other thing this news station set was very obviously in another realm sort of. It was cloudy looking, shaky and the outside looked like stars in space. Usually my dreams are clear like a memory I am certain of in HD."

I haven‚Äôt thought of her in months and I would like to say I‚Äôm pretty much over her as the relationship ended in her telling me she fell out of love with me. I was hurt at the time but moved on because I had more important things to focus on . I definitely let the breakup run its course though and worked it all out in my head and heart, as it did hurt. But like I said I haven‚Äôt though about her in months and really have no emotions connected to her anymore nor have I been in contact with her since the whole breakup. But anyways I had a really stressful and long day at work and got home early so I took a little nap. During that nap I had a dream where I ended back up at her place and in her room. The dream had a very weird atmosphere and not a good feeling to it. The vibe was definitely off. We were kind of on the opposite sides of the room but still having conversation. I don‚Äôt remember everything in full detail but I do remember her telling me how it was nice seeing me again and it almost felt like she was trying to reconnect with me. She was also saying how it was nice to be around each other again , she complemented me on my looks and was saying how I looked good. We ended up talking a bit more from what I remember but don‚Äôt remember about what exactly. But then before the dream ended‚Ä¶ I started choking , it felt like my whole throat was full of phlegm that I could not get out . After coughing and gagging trying to clear my throat I woke up. I had a really weird feeling upon waking up and everything just didn‚Äôt feel right the rest of the day. Is there any hidden message that just like flew right over my head? Or anything I should take note of? Anything helps, this was such a weird dream and experience and have never had a dream anything like this at all. Even after the breakup I never had a dream like this. Any further questions I‚Äôd be happy to answer but I‚Äôm genuinely confused as to what the dream means.

Also, I take 2 types of sleeping medication so it might not even be a dream it could just be chemicals; but anyway,\n\nIt started around 2 years ago after a very stressful event. It began almost like an out of body experience, where I knew I was asleep, I always know I'm asleep, but it felt like I was drifting upwards and could see my body from above. Kinda fun but I also didn't wanna float away too far incase I never came back, it was as if i knew I couldn't float too far away because something not so nice would happen, but still kinda funky. \n\nI'm not sure when, but then they started to get darker. I'd 'wake up', open my eyes and see something in my room, and I started to feel like I was no longer floating up- but going down. I lived alone and ended up moving house where I live with other people. I thought that would make it go away but it hasn't.\n\nNow I'm not scared of it, but its more of an annoyance. I go to sleep, I wake up and I just start dream-punching whatever shadowy figure is beside me until I wake up. The imagined presence doesn't feel like some sort of evil entity, but it's also not very comforting? And it also doesn't feel like the same 'presence' each time. I just don't feel like watching me sleep is a very cool thing to do so like, get out of my house. Last night, it felt as if I was slowly being sucked off my bed and vacuumed downwards. I can always wake myself up by shadowboxing air. Maybe it's sleep paralysis, but why it happens every night I'm not sure. I have a certain trick to get rid of it, and if I do that before bed I never get those dreams- but I'm not always in the mood every single night if you get me\n\nAlso, the dreams never happen if there's someone else physically in my room, like if I'm babysitting a cat or get lucky enough to bring someone home one night.\n\nBut who the hell am I fighting in my sleep?"

I then fall off the bed and get some sort of head injury. I begin screaming for my mom, but she walks away to get someone else. I then starting puking this clear liquid, that was causing me issues to breath. She comes back and say \"just breathe\" then she gets on the phone to call my grandma and uncle to give us a ride to the hospital. Well they started arguing, then my mom gets mad and says forget it she's not going to help. I then remember trying to stumble out of the room- but I was unable to see properly. Like my vision was of me in some sort of dark hallway with multiple doors and stairs. I was still calling out to my mom with no help or answer. Somehow I make it outside and cops appear, and so does my mom . At this time, she appears concerned talking about \"someone help her , my baby\" It changed to me in the hospital, in a surgery room. I was awake, and the doctor put some sort of iv into my side/abdominal area. I remember that my brain had a infection, and they was trying to pump antibiotics directly into my stomach. \nThen very vividly-like this felt so real. I started puking, and choking on my own blood. I remember in the dream I felt very fearful but I was trying to stay calm and breath. Like, I felt my \"light\" fading out. I really felt death creep up, slowly. I had enough time to acknowledge the fact that I was dying, and to be scared. Briefly I tried to fight it, then I accepted-even said a small prayer to God something like \"Forgive me father, and if this is my time I accept this. Take me\" once that was said I \"fell unconscious\" in my dream and saw some sort of light. A beautiful welcoming light, i felt a sense of peace, love and longing. Like I really wanted to go, fully ready to set life aside and move on to the light. Once my \"soul\" begin leaving from my body, the dream ended and I woke up. I was very confused, and sad that I was not able to reach the light. Like my first thought was \"I wanted to go\" \n\nI'm not really sure the meaning or message of this dream,but I cannot emphasize enough on how real everything felt. When I was choking I really felt like I was losing my breath. When I was \"dying\" - I really believe I felt the presence of Death itself. Seriously, I woke up sad that I didn't die for real? How strange is that?\n\nAnyway, thank you for taking your time reading this. If you have any insights, or interpretations please leave a comment. I'd love to see how other people see the meaning behind this, or have experienced something similar."

I manage to stab it a few times, and it manages to sink its teeth into my leg. I run away, but it makes its way onto land and I'm now playing hide and seek with it hoping it doesn't find me.

The great white shark we've been trying to kill for generations is *right there!* why won't you help?\" They finally listen and come to the hole, but at this point the shark has already run off, though I get the sense it's only been temporarily defeated.

I remember my actual consciousness thought all of this was 100% real and I was wondering how i died irl. I then landed in my bed and woke up and was in such shock I thought I was really dead and just didn't make it heaven like I thought I was. I thought real life was actually fake/back in purgatory or something so I woke up my partner to make sure i was actually alive. Most bizarre realistic dream I've had on a long time. totally had me questioning my sanity for a bit this morning lol"

I dreamt that I had woken up from a coma that had lasted 15 years, saw that my two sons had grown up without me, and felt hurt knowing they had no father because I was asleep the whole time. \n\n2. My wife and I were getting our car repaired and decided to put cooking oil in the gas tank. We left the workshop and eventually broke down again in the desert. \n\nIf anyone is interested in taking a crack at the meaning of either or both of these, I‚Äôd appreciate it!"

    "body": "Hello all.  I would like help with interpreting a dream that I had last night. There was more to the dream than what I am about to write, but I can only vividly remember the part that I want help with interpreting. \n\nThe part of the dream that I only have a broad rememberance of has to do with me going about my daily life which were things such as shopping, visits to relatives (or what felt like relatives) and such. Then all of a sudden, I am assuming, nearing the end of my sleep, I was in an explosion (or blown up). With my body still in tact,  I was hurled into the sky spiraling closer and closer to outer space without protective equipment of any sort on so I had no oxygen to assist me with breathing. As I am moving further into space, I start feeling pressure build up in my body. I then started gasping for air. Everything around me starts to get dark as I inch closer and into space. I feel like the explosion and being sent into space happened at least twice in a row. Then, I woke up."

It felt like a cat headbutt, and I could feel whatever it was nestling up to me and snuggling. I looked and It was a smallish wild owl. It was so sweet and gentle and we were instantly best friends. We played together for a little while with it?him?her? on my left arm and her claws were really cutting up my arm. I was bleeding a lot, my whole arm was drenched in blood. It didn't hurt or disturb me at all as we were enjoying eachothers company and some random person was like \"yooooo, that's a lot of blood, you good?\" And I responded \"yeah it doesnt hurt, we are friends\"\n\n\nThis is days after I was calling back and forth to an owl in a national forest.

    "body": "Hello all! I‚Äôm gonna get straight to the point: i had a dream and in this dream someone was showing me two goldfishes. One fish, swam happily in a tank with nothing else but clear, clean water. The other fish, on the other hand, was outside the tank; this fish stood on the tip of its mouth, meaning it stood straight up but instead of on its tail it stood the opposite way, on its head.\n\nIn the black community, this often means someone you know is pregnant, and i can attest to this. I once had a dream of two dead fish, just the bones, swimming around in clear water. A friend of mine unfortunately had a miscarriage soon after with twins.\n\nThe part that concerns me the most is the fish outside of the tank. I am aware that seeing fish also means wealth and success, so what could the upside down fish mean?"

I (M,22), talked to this girl 2 years ago, we never officially dated, but we talked quite a bit and got pretty close physically.\n\nIt ended after a couple months and we are still friendly and Snapchat but she lives in another city so I never see her.\n\nThe dream I just had felt incredibly real and ominous. I was at a house with my buddy who set us up. I invited her there to be friendly. She ended up convincing me to let her sleep with me. However throughout the night, she began being disrespectful to me, trashing my house, and not being present. When I called her on it, she turned very cold and admitted she was using me. \n\nI told her off and she went to bed, and then the dream shifted to a party with a bunch of my friends. At this point, I was talking to one of my friends when they nudge me and point out to me she had come out of the room with a crazed look in her eye. She was (weirdly enough) trying to tickle me (or something like that) and I had to like grab her and keep her off of me, calling out to my friends to help me get her away. It was like she was possessed. When I realized I couldn‚Äôt stop her, I woke up to find myself in a bit of a sweat.\n\nThe only other thing I can remember from the dream is that I was out on the street by some bars at one point trying to get home, but my legs were hardly working, pulling me in random directions or being stuck. This feeling has occurred in many dreams before.\n\nDoes anyone see any potential meaning from this dream? Sorry if this is long.

Sometimes 3 times a week, other days once a week. All of the dreams felt really real, as in its sometimes that could happen in real time and not the happy ending type of dreams (y'know things like getting back together, him reaching out to me in a romantical way, or marriage). For example:\n\n\\- The first week after i ended things, I dreamt about wanting to reach out to him on whatsapp, or either me looking at his contact details while debating on contacting him again. I felt like i really missed him (i do irl but i didn't want to because i know its not good for me at the moment), but at the end I didn't contact him in my dreams. I dreamt about this multiple times.\n\n\\- Then it progressed to me visiting his hometown (we live in different states), I went to his close friend's cafe and then we met by chance there. He didn't seem like he wanted to talk to me but he stuck around and didn't leave the cafe until my dream finished. Same thing, just me visiting him or him visiting me but we don't talk at all.\n\n\\- Or sometimes even just me dreaming of looking at him, no words spoken but just looking at him.\n\n\\- And last night, i dreamt about playing a game together with him (we are both gamers) and we were talking again but for some reason he was streaming his gameplay on twitch while playing with me? The vibe was okay and he was like before things started going downhill for us.\n\nAny ideas what these dreams mean?

    "body": "I once had a (non lucid) dream which started with me flying a biplane, by myself, from the hangar near my home. I did half of a barrel roll then slipped out of the plane and plummeted to the ground far below, but I did not hit the ground. I suddenly found myself in a small white room with a kids table and chairs, there were some cubbies on the wall and a tall dark entity in the corner. This was many years ago and I don't remember much else.\n\n\nMore recently, only a year or two ago, when I was really into lucid dreaming I dreamt that I woke up from a foreign bed in a stained-wood room. When I was able to detach from my physical body and move freely in the dream I left the room and found a stone hallway that lead to an open area. Directly in front of thw hallway was a large opening that revealed I was in a carved-out cave. To the left there was what felt like a kitchen. To the right there was an open area that was not lit by thw outside light and was very dark. It was epecially dark behind a stone pillar where I felt a presence. The presence stepped into the light and was my grandmother, this is when I fully realized I was in a dream, and the excitement woke me up. Eager to continue the expeince I went back to sleep, but I did not find myself inside the cave with my grandma. This time I was fully lucid inside an office building. I explored a bit and found an opening that met with a yellow lake. There were mountains off to the right. Above to the left there was a bridge-like structure so I spider-man swung up to it. I dipped into the waters and saw that from below/within it was a mucky brown-yellow, unlike the lovely golden surface. I felt like a see monster was gonna get me so I got above the bridge as quick as possible. The waters washed away the control I normally have in a lucid dream but I still remained quite conscious as I landed on the structure and found a large metal clearing with a small black pyramid a hundered or so meters away that had golden markings in a language I do not know. I found myself directly in front of the pyramid and felt the presence of a tall entity behind me (I don't remember seeing them but in my mind they ooked like Anubis). This being wordlessly communicated to me that their world was in danger and the moon was needed to save them, then the clouds dissipated enough for a giant moon to shine it's brilliance on the pyramid and it's golden writings started glowing blue. Then the glowing stopped as the moon was again covered by clouds. Had I remembered that I was dreaming I would've moved the clouds myself (I've done so before, pulling clouds together and darkening them to conjure lightning, I assume I could pull them apart too) so the best thing I could think to do was call on the Greek goddess of the moon, Artemis. When I shouted her name I felt what I could only describe as a ripple across realms. Then I was ripped from that world and into a grey-white limbo where I felt like I was falling in multiple directions while myriad voices were talking angrily but I couldn't hear them, not until one said \"you are the worst of us\" then I woke myself up bc that sh*t was terrifying...\n\nI'd love to hear some interpretations of what these dreams may have meant!"

I see a hole in the floor and lower myself into a stank, wet area and I see him walk by.  \n\n2nd- I'm an apartment decorated all in white.  I see a woman with long super straight blond hair, also dressed in white walking around completely straight face.  No emotion.  She's with another women who looks like that.  They're flirting or interacting bizarrely.  One is lying down and the other is touching her face with her foot (toes).  As I hide behind a pillar/wall, I see they've swapped places and now the other women does the same, but this time the woman instead of caressing her with her foot, she steps on her face.

    "body": "Key word \"loosely\".  It's on the general design of player characters and their general culture that carried over into the dreams.  Everything else was different\n\nThe game these dreams were drawing from is this one.  [Sky: Children of the Light](https://youtu.be/aBQRCHusYyU)\n\nThere were a lot of differences in the dream though.  For example, in the game, while you can swim under water as a secondary mechanic, it's jenky and you have a limited oxygen supply and the main emphasis in the game is on the flying mechanics instead.\n\nIn my dream, it was the opposite.  Yes, I was my in game character, but it was a world where the sky people were largely amphibious.  Even though we could go above land or even fly if they wanted to, we needed to be underwater to truly flourish\n\nI first caught a glimpse of this world in another dream a few nights ago.  I was living in an underwater city with a gamified version of my family.  But I came up to the surface one morning and noticed off in the distance, miles away, what looked to be a beautiful stone mansion on a hillside at the top of a ravine that we were in the middle of\n\nI asked my dad about it and he told me to stay away from that place.  He said that those were invaders who had drained most of the water in the valley which had once been a large river and the we were left with only a fraction of our original territory as a result.\n\nHe warned me never to go near them.  Said they were hostile and hated us.  He said they were scared of us because of our mobility as the only known race who could swim, fly, and run with ease.  They thought we could ambush them at any time and they wouldn't be able to defend themselves\n\nI thought that was ridiculous because we were a pretty peaceful race (look at the game Sky for reference.  It was practically the same thing).  So when nobody was looking I decided I wanted to go talk to them, and took off on the long flight across the ravine\n\nAnd that's where the first dream ended.\n\nOh, and did I mention the \"invaders\" were humans?  That seems pretty important\n\nSo last night's dream seemed to pick up where the first one left off.  Actually, I think I might have even skipped over some stuff because it started inside the mansion with no context for how I got there or how the people living there initially reacted when I showed up\n\nAll I knew was that I shouldn't be there and was desperate to get out\n\nAnd while there were people in the mansion, all dressed in formal wear and drinking martinis, they weren't actively screaming or throwing things at me or anything extreme.  Instead, they all just gave me \"the look\".  You know the one.  That hateful death glare you'd shoot at someone when you're barely tolerating their presence and want them to just leave ; a barely contained rage seething just beneath the surface, threatening to boil over\n\nEventually, I got to what must have been the mansion's front entrance because I saw something that took my breath away\n\nI saw a large dam miles tall and even further in with, and beyond it, an endless expanse of ocean.  I could have just dived into all that water and never looked back; freer than I'd ever been\n\nBut I couldn't\n\nMy family was in the opposite direction.  And if I went out that way, I'd likely never see them again\n\nSo, reluctantly, I had to turn back.  I had to go back through the mansion\n\nLuckily, it had one of those main foyer type of setups where the front and rear exits are essentially connected by a long hallway with rooms branching off.  So it didn't take long to find the exit\n\nI ran out onto the patio dived straight into some water, thinking in the moment that I was home free.  I gulped in lungfuls of water with the same eagerness that you might when coming up for air after swimming.  It was a beautiful place with lots of colorful coral and sunlight refracting onto the bottom\n\nBut that moment was short lived\n\nTurns out it was only a retention pond.  And as I begrudgingly crawled up the rocky shore on the other side, I found, to my dismay, a large brick wall, at least two stories tall, separating the mansion from what lay beyond it.\n\nI would have just flown to the top, but I was too wore out.  My wings didn't work.  So I had to climb up.\n\nIt took ages and it hurt a lot.  But eventually, I made it to the top.  And on the other side, I found that same ravine from the first dream.\n\nThe small lake my family lived in was miles away; nothing but a pitiful creek at the bottom on the way there.  And I couldn't fly anymore.  So I knew I had a long, difficult journey ahead of me\n\nThen I woke up\n\nDISCLAIMER: If this came off as long winded or disjointed.  I'm sorry.  I just woke up and I needed to get this out of my head while it was still fresh\n\nEDIT: Also, I don't know if it matters, but [this is what my game character looks like](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/902562752734842961/1108404748551462973/SKY_20230506_185844_.jpg) and it's more or less how I looked in the dream too"

In the dream I went to a party and I saw my best friend who I haven't talked to in a while and his family was there and one of the family members said \"oh that is girl who inspired all your drawings\" and we sat down on the couch very close and he told me he likes me. And the funny thing is I have feelings for him and he knows that and I know he has feelings for me but he doesn't like expressing his emotions. What do y'all think that means?

    "body": "Woke up screaming in the middle of the night last night. I had a dream of people breaking into my house and killing me. A woman, and 2 men. The woman seemed to be in charge. These same people held me captive in a different nightmare so as soon as I saw them I knew they were going to try to kill me. I saw the woman outside my house first. Ran around locking doors and windows when I realized a window was busted and they were already in my house. So I ran to my closet. I remember panicking when I got to my closet thinking ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way for me to escape from here, why would I hide somewhere with no exits?‚Äù So I tried calling the police. They had cut my Wi-Fi somehow so I had to turn my Wi-Fi off and call again (doesn‚Äôt make sense I know lol) and as I‚Äôm otp with dispatch, too huge, bald, angry men with large machetes open my closet door. I knew it was over. There was no escape. No convincing them not to kill me. No fighting them off. I grabbed my boyfriend who was in the closet with me, hid my face in him so I didn‚Äôt see what they were about to do to me, and told him ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù (we don‚Äôt say that to each other yet irl) then I woke up screaming."

They were similar to a spider‚Äôs legs in shape. \n\nI walked up to the tree to touch its trunk and the moment I did, I was pursued by beings whose appearance I can‚Äôt remember. I just remember many were on horses and at least one was floating while they had me surrounded. \n\nThere was also someone there who was familiar but I couldn‚Äôt place it, and they kept indicating some kind of betrayal.\n\nI escaped and ran to a large building nearby with black double doors with windows inlaid but was knocked unconscious by my pursuers. \n\nAt that point my perspective switched to someone inside (a healer or leader of some sort) and they dragged (unconscious) me inside while the pursuers distanced themselves from this person. \n\nI couldn‚Äôt even start to understand this and would appreciate if anyone has any insight!"

    "body": "I (22f) have had at least 1 to 2 dreams every year where the same person (22m) shows up, usually in the role of a love interest. The dreams range from pleasant to scary to anxiety producing. I don‚Äôt remember them really but he would usually support me or help me fix the in-dream problem.\n\nI first met this guy was the summer before 6th grade at a camp we went to. I definitely thought he was cute, and was absolutely floored when I passed by him in the school hallway a couple months later. Throughout middle school I developed a crush that I would like to think was similar to crushing on your favorite celebrity in the sense that I knew there was no way in hell I stood a chance, but I couldn‚Äôt stop admiring him for his personality, smarts, and looks. I was always nervous to not appear stupid if he was around and was actively trying to be quieter when I‚Äôm usually pretty up-beat. \n\nIn high school there were a few classes we had together, and I would always have the feeling he would be glancing at me. I‚Äôd catch him looking away (because of course I would be glancing at him every now and then) and I even did the yawn test just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt overthinking it. He yawned. Despite all of this, we had different friend groups, never spoke to each other unless we had to, and I still dated other people. I don‚Äôt believe he ever dated anyone until college. Both of our families go to the same synagogue and my dad and his dad are friends. \n\nI can‚Äôt remember when the dreams started but they were a lot more frequent than they are now. At first I just thought it was a one-off but it‚Äôs been 4 years since I‚Äôve seen him in person and I‚Äôm in a different state because of school. He is also currently in a relationship but I‚Äôve been so busy focusing on myself that I haven‚Äôt given him the time of day. I keep telling myself that I‚Äôm just overthinking everything, but the fact that he specifically has been more reoccurring than people who have hurt me or even those I cherish just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. Does his reappearance in my dreams actually mean anything? Am I suppressing feelings? Or am I just overthinking it?"

    "body": "So in this dream I was staying at a barn during a party for some reason with some friends of mine, they were smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol while I just sat in some hay looking at the fenced landscape. After some time, I go inside the barn and I find lots of people who were drinking, doing drugs and partying whilst lights shined around and music played in the background, but that's not what surprised me the most, because there was a pale young lion sitting near 2 wooden poles looking back at me, it didn't seem like it wanted to harm me so I get a bit closer so that I can see it in case it decides to pounce at me while I'm distracted or something.\n\nSome time goes by and people start putting on louder music and start jumping around, this makes the lion uncomfortable, resulting in him standing up and walking away from his spot, but whilst he strides forward, his paw meets with a woman's foot and his claws sink into it, causing her to scream in pain. This makes everyone briefly stop and then start screaming and running around, while makes the lion when more scared, resulting in him biting the people who come close to him defensively. \n\nI don't know what's the meaning of this dream but I'm sure it has something to do with responsibility. I don't wanna sound like one of those annoying people that bug people who smoke or drink but the people at the party were clearly indulging recklessly, something not very responsible, and the lion also was not restrained in any way, he wasn't in a cage or with a leash tying him to those poles, he was completely free and able to do whatever he so desired to do. I think that the lion represent the responsibility (or lack thereof), once the people began to do all kinds of irresponsible things, the lion grew more and more agitated, and when the breaking point happened, he completely lashed out at everyone. \n\nWhat do you guys think this could possibly mean?"

Also, I realize lions mane causes nightmares I won‚Äôt be taking it at night anymore, but still, I‚Äôve recently read nightmares are the brains way to cope with trauma. So, with that being said I was ok with it happening eventually. \n\nFirst the dream started off as a NSFW dream w/ my girlfriend, there is definitely lead up to the second part, but I don‚Äôt recall, (I absolutely know there was more in between, but absolutely nothing is recalled, up until the nightmare, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve experienced that before).\n\nNow, I was with my boys and girl, we called into a haunted house to go visit it, we set reservations. When we got there, nobody took are tickets at the door, it was just open and nobody there. We went in and we were giggling and thought it was funny and waiting for a jump scare, although, nothing was happening so we got confused and a little creeped out. It was a dark, cold and empty house. \n\nWe decided to go upstairs, I walked into the bathroom and before I even got in I saw a extremely tall, skinny, lengthy man who looked like he hadn‚Äôt eaten in years. All I remember seeing was his foot which was extremely bruised, but somehow I know exactly what he looked liked without even looking at his whole body. Weird I know.  \n\nHis face looked like the rake, but I didn‚Äôt see it visually I just knew, it‚Äôs confusing, but yeah. I slammed the door shut and freaked the f*** out I told everyone and we realized we probably should get the hell out and this wasn‚Äôt what we thought. We ran to the door and everything closed, everything. Windows locked, doors locked, everything immediately as we attempted to escape. \n\nWe then heard the man climbing around in the ceiling like an extremely loud spider. My buddy Jeff decided to get out on the outside patio which wasn‚Äôt unlocked, although somehow we all knew we weren‚Äôt allowed to leave, but he tried anyway. When outside the patio it was gated and he jumped off which was literally a small 3 foot drop maximum, and he immediately broke apart, legs amputated, arms still intact to his torso blood everywhere. \n\nWhat really bothered me was he was still alive and was attempting to scoop his organs and intestines back into his stomach and get his legs back. He was screaming and yelling help me! \n\nWe called the cops, (not when we were locked in a house with spider-demon-man, but when are friend fucking exploded into a million pieces, I know, I guess horror movies and dreams follow the same rule, being dumb). \n\nThey came and he was asking them for help cause he was still alive and they just threw him to the side where there was another mysterious dead body. Then I woke up with the worst derealization and anxiety, but yeah, anybody think there is any meaning? \n\nMy home life hasn‚Äôt been the best lately and I‚Äôve been going through a lot of stress, also sorry for the long ass wall of text, this just helped me to journal it, thanks for reading!"

I put clothes in it for some unknown reason, but I remember they were clean clothes and not dirty clothes. I beat myself up about it and my step-dad says it's okay. Its during the time my mom serves dinner, and there's only enough food left for me and none left for my step-dad. I tell him 'here you can have the rest'. He says thank you and I choose to go without. It's a warm feeling.\nWell, cut to a scene the next morning, I notice shoots of asparagus growing out of my back! Three of them, and they're all flowering like the same one I was growing. I started freaking out and asked my Unphased parents if I should remove them myself. My mom said No because they would leave big open wounds that would get infected. I said You're Right. I begged my mom to take me to the hospital so I can get them removed. She ended up taking me, and they suggested taking me to a Special Hospital as this was a Special Case that doesn't happen everyday.\nI go up the stairs and my mom guides me to walk to the door in front of me. I walk through, and she immediately closes the door behind me. I try to open it but it won't open, I try to bang on it to have someone open it from the other side, no luck. \nI was scared and panicky. Inside was a waiting room with alot of windows with sun and plenty of chairs. There were two guys about my age (I'm going to be 23 here in a few days) who were sitting together in the corner not saying anything. They just looked at me as I sat there and made me feel uncomfortable. They got up and sat closer to me. They looked mentally unstable. I got up and moved away from them, playing musical chairs. Then they got up and moved closer to me again. At this time I told them I didn't feel comfortable and I'd just like to sit alone please. They didn't answer and I got up and decided to walk around to see if they followed. They followed me and looked like they were going to hurt me. I walked fast and noticed  the back office where a bunch of women were working with medications and documents and computers, and went into their area saying these 2 were going to hurt me. They didn't seem to care, and one of the guys ended up tackling me down, cutting my airway to breathe. I kept trying to scream saying I can't breathe I can't breathe, I'm going to die, I'm dead. One of the ladies there nonchalantly helped him off me and told them not to do it again. I was questioning why they didn't take it more seriously. The guys left me alone but were close by. I walked within the back office to try to be safe if anything happened. The 2 guys ccame in again and I was walking away from them as they followed me . They kept following me and I asked the ladies if this was normal and why they weren't doing anything. I then find another patient in the back office like me who kind of signals he's been going through the same thing but it is what it is. They medicate him and he just has to deal with it. \nI confront the girls and ask why they don't help the issue. One of the boss ladies insinuates that the two guys' family owns the hospital and they are being paid to let them do whatever they want. I spoke out against it and said it wasn't right and how your letting them control how you do your job and knowingly hurting people instead of helping. \nIt was then one girl came up behind me and syringed my foot with some sort of tranquilizer thing and I faded out.\nI woke up there in the same spot again and went in and said the same thing. How they are knowingly hurting people under their control. As I said it the second time,  I can see 2 or 3 girls side with me. However the bosses didn't like that and they said they weren't going to listen to me anymore and basically to syringe me again. One of the girls who was siding with me got the syringe but gave me a look and was reluctant. I said I don't need this to get better, I just need these plants out of my back so I can go home.\nThen I woke up. \n\nIn real life, I've just taken up gardening for the first time and am obsessed with growing my plants. Also, I just had asparagus for dinner last night but I don't live at my parents house. I've actually been living with Mt fiance in our own apartment for the last 2 years. Also, I am taking prescription drugs right now for depression and anxiety, but I've always felt they were a dead end and weren't fixing a problem. I felt that they couldn't fix my mood swings problem and that I actually have to work on that myself- no medication could fix it. \n\nSo please share with me what you think this dream is trying to tell me, thank you :)"

My dog was barking and I became worried that the man would think the house was empty, and open to being robbed. So, I went to the door and cracked it. I made up a lie, \"my dad and brother's are just upstairs, cleaning their guns.\" But he had this wide grin as I said goodbye and shut the door. I think he was looking for directions he said. It's  close to bed time now and I have a vivid memory of this fist punching straight through the glass window by the door. I tried to get away but I couldn't. I don't have a memory of dreaming of the assault, but I know he raped me in the dream.\nThen I woke up, screaming and crying in my own bed, running to my mom. I told her about the dream I had before I saw my step dad. I ran to him and began crying even harder... then I actually woke up."

Being in a car with my father who I haven‚Äôt been in contact with in almost 5 years. Sometimes I‚Äôm trapped and sometimes we are just in the car. I‚Äôve been having this dream for the last 1-2 years. \n2. Having one last shift at my previous job which I left 1.5 years ago. I do not miss the job at all. \n3. I try to communicate but my words are slurred and I can‚Äôt get out what I‚Äôm trying to say. I had never had this dream until recently. \n4. Needing to push my jaw forwards to give myself an underbite or clanging my teeth together. I have had this one in the past too. \n5. Various dreams about buses/trains/ubers.\n6. The most concerning and weird one - I have a really bad taste in my mouth and have to vomit it out. The taste is so significant that I wake up feeling like it was real. \nI would be so grateful if anyone knows what any of these dreams may mean!!"

It was both my flat and not, as the outside appearance of the hallway was that of an old work friend who I used to get high with. The building was actually that of the butcher (who used to be part owner of a cafe I used to work in). Inside the flat was a short hallway into a large room (my living current living room but with couches from when I was a child) \n\nIn the dream I decided I was going to get some cocaine. I knew it was a bad idea as I was working the next day but I did anyway. Someone showed up to sell me it. He seemed like an undesirable ( a ned/chav). I put the coke out as 5 lines but only took 3 because I was working, then lay down on the couch which turned into my current bed. As I lag there I could hear / see the coke dealer outside with another, both are dressed in tracksuits and are faceless. I know they are planning to Rob me, and can see one pulling out a knife. They allude to me being alone and being an easy target. As I lie in my bed I'm aware but not afraid. \n\nThen a big black shadow presence appear over the top of me from behind. It leans over me and I hear \"there's evil inside\". I woke up pretty scared\n\n\n\n\nFor context, I'm 31 yo man. I am a recovering addict, not cocaine though.  I recently relapsed but am 60 days clean again. I've recently started therapy where we're trying to work on me understanding feelings, more specifically anger/ agression."

This stranger offered help and I didn‚Äôt even look at him until we got to the car. We had small talk the way out and when I saw him I became aware of dreaming. I asked him about his life and his face lit up as he told me he was with his dream girl ‚ÄúAdrianna‚Äù. That‚Äôs me. I asked how they met and he said he doesn‚Äôt remember because they constantly make new memories. He asked if I‚Äôd come down the road real quick to grab something from a friends. I agreed and we walked and when we came up to the house there was a pocket knife on the side walk out front. I ignored it, we go inside and it‚Äôs a studio with like 10 black cats throughout. I sat on the day bed there and it immediately felt disgusting. I peeled back the cushion and there was hands and feet stacked up on top of each othe, like the couch was filled with bodies. I stayed calm and subtly showed him and asked to leave. He looked concerned but stayed cool, we left in this car. As we were driving I asked him about our hometown and he said he‚Äôs never been.

    "body": "I should start off by saying I am experiencing cannabis withdrawals, which is known to trigger more vivid and surreal dreams. \n\nLast night I had a dream that I befriended a disabled race car driver. His disabilities were from birth rather than an accident, but were incredibly severe and horrific. His legs were twisted and bent behind his back, and he had a pair of dead eyes which protruded from the top of his head. He also had prosthetic eyes where his real eyes should have been. At first he seemed pleasant, and I believe I worked in the garage that maintained his race car. At some point in the dream, we were both attending a party. Somehow, my friend had morphed into an even more deformed female , and was arguing with another woman at the party. All of a sudden, the disfigured woman began horrifically murdering the other woman. Tearing her breasts off, just an absolutely horrific scene. I fled from the party, found myself at the bottom of a grassy hill where I found my real life wife. We saw the disabled person at the top of the hill. They were now even larger, even more disfigured and resembled more of a monster than a person, yet in my mind I knew it was the same person all along. Me and my wife make a run for it and the dream ends. \n\nI remembered the dream when I woke, but it didn‚Äôt disturb me too much. It was only later in the day thinking about the dream that it‚Äôs really starting to bother me.  \n\nAfter typing this out I have come up with my own interpretation: \n\nThe disabled person is my addiction to cannabis. He is disabled because my addiction limits me almost like a disability. As he becomes more deformed, it is my addiction spiraling out of control. The woman he murders at the party is an element of my healthy psyche, which has been harmed by my cannabis use. I flee from the killer just like I have decided to leave cannabis behind. The disabled person becomes increasingly horrific and harmful just like my cannabis use was once a minor issue has spiraled into a potential catastrophe for my personal life. I found and fled with my wife because she really did save me from my addiction.\n\nWhilst I realize many people can have a casual relationship with cannabis, I have been a daily user from a young age which has undoubtably become a harmful addiction."

    "body": "Recently I've had a couple weird end of the world dreams, that I saw pretty close to each other. Just the concept of what was happening in them was so bizarre that I wrote down they key points as soon as woke up so that I don't forget them. They messed with my brain pretty hard. This is the first one I saw a few weeks ago.\n\nIt starts with me standing near a house. It appears that according to the situation I am in the dream - this is a house I grew up in, even though it is completely untrue in reality. There is a woman with me, my age, that appears to be my sister (not really, I don't have a sister). It is dusk, the sun is disappearing behind the horizon and the sky is red. The house is located close to a highway that climbs a rather steep hill. Everywhere I look in the yard (it looks kinda overgrown and abandoned, like it hasn't been taken care of for a while) I recall some chunks of memories of being a kid and growing up, playing there (which are obviously not real, I grew up living in an apartment).\n\nI walk towards the hill together with the woman. She is telling me something that I don't remember any more. I remember getting a very strong feeling of nostalgia and at the same time a feeling of great sadness because this is the last time I am going to see this place and the person next to me. We reach the top of the hill and I look down on the road and the forest below me. I don't know what makes me feel this - I have never seen that place or that woman in my life. And the feeling is very strong. I can't say I experienced anything like that for any place or person in the real life.\n\nThen the setting suddenly changes - I am standing in a park in the middle of the day. There are people around me, who are panicking. And I suddenly remember that there is something terrifying that appeared in the sky recently. Apparently, there is a new moon in the sky now. It is called Solomon's Shadow (I don't know where the name came from, in the dream I just know that this is what the moon is called). And it is an organic! moon. Meaning it is basically a huge living organism (but not conscious, it is basically like a plant or a primitive organism, or something like that). Sometimes it emits a ray of black light (literally a black beam) that destroys anything it covers (buildings, people the ground itself). It does this at random so basically there is no safe place on the planet where it can't reach. Whether or not you die is a lottery, there is no point in hiding. And the consensus is that there is no way to get rid of it and that it is going to destroy the Earth eventually. \n\nI look up at the sky and see this new moon. It looks like a dark pink blob of organic matter. It is around the same size as the sun appears in the sky. As I look at it, it emits the black beam somewhere not far from me and I hear people screaming. Then some female voice near me is saying \"It is growing. Will you go inside?\".  As I look it makes me feel a weird feeling of... awe, I guess? After a few moments I suddenly get pulled directly towards the moon and sucked inside of it. The same female voice says \"New module is growing. Module 1 - the flower\". When I appear inside the moon it looks like a pinkish sphere with rapidly growing plants and flowers inside of it. There are huge flat platforms randomly appearing in midair, made up of winding greenery. The space inside of it is huge, absolutely immense. I get suspended in the air for a few moments and then start freefalling. At which point I wake up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what to make of it. It just felt weird. Such a strange mixture of emotions - feeling so sad and nostalgic like I never felt before about the place I am seeing for the first time, and the whole experience of the new moon."

    "body": "!! TW GORE !!\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nRecently I've been having these really weird nightmares. I don't remember my dreams often but recently I've been remembering dreams that caused me a lot of distress. Ive been watching war documentaries/horror genre recently. I haven't felt scared or uncomfortable while watching this stuff, more like intrigued. But when I have dreams about this stuff it feels traumatic in the moment.\n\nDream #1\n\nLet me start off by saying when I had this dream, I was super sick and had a really high fever. I felt genuinely so awful I convinced myself I had to go to the hospital. But instead my mom slept in my room with me and helped me throughout the night. \n\nI really don't remember much of this dream, or if it was more of a hallucination. But I had convinced myself the Chinese Government was hunting me down and wanting to preform experimental heart surgeries on me. They had these six different mechanical contraptions they would place inside my heart. They would then see which one worked best. This meant six different surgeries, if I didn't die. I remember waking up sobbing to my mom in the middle of the night about how they were after me and trying to kill me. She would reassure me that I was okay and needed to go back to sleep. My head was throbbing though and my heart felt physically hurt, even though no damage was done. I was in and out of sleep for hours, either waking up in terror about how they were hunting me down, or waking up to throw up. \n\nGenuinely one of the worst nights I've ever had. \n\nDream #2\n\nThis one happened maybe two nights after the first one mentioned (Just last night.) This one was very similar, except I stayed asleep for the whole dream and didn't wake up sobbing and delusional.\n\nIn this one, I had to get my four wisdom teeth removed. (I have it planned I have to get mine actually removed within the next year or so.) In this dream, I was in a dimly lit office, I wasn't nervous for the procedure, except for maybe the pain afterwards. I was aware of how this was going to work, so I was confident in it. I was put on one of those metal surgery tables, they drugged me up, and I was out. They removed the four teeth just fine, and I felt nothing. However, near the end of the procedure the anesthesia wore off and I was awake again. For some reason for the procedure they had to slit my wrists and let me bleed out. I was aware of this since the beginning, but for some reason the doctor couldn't do it, which meant I had to preform this myself. I grabbed a knife on the tray next to my table, and created several deep slits all over my forearm. I remember this being excruciatingly painful, as this was supposed to be done by the surgeon while I was unconscious. I had to lower my forearm to let the blood drip down my arm, and let me tell you, there was a lot of it. After the surgery, I remember questioning if they had really taken my teeth out, which my mom reached into my mouth and pressed down where they had previously been. \"Feel that? that means they're gone!\" I also had several scars all along my forearm.\n\nThat's all I remember from this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing to mention is there were no faces for any of the surgeons. I don't have any trauma from surgery or any medical procedures, although it does make me a little weary. Nothing too bad ever, just a little nervous. \n\nI'm really curious as to what you guys think these could mean."

Don't exactly remember what he was telling me but we passed this wall with terrarium inserts with blue glowing items. I made a remark on their beauty and he told me how important the color blue was. I entered the elevator while he stood in front and stayed outside the elevator and there was a lady inside the elevator waiting. I wanted to press a button but then she quickly pressed it before I could, although I didn't even know where I was headed. \n\nSuddenly the elevator shot upwards crazy fast and it made me scared af, holding onto the sides. When it reached the top, the elevator started swinging back and forth like a seesaw, as if it wasn't balanced. The doors opened and there was a platform hanging in front of it held by ropes from the ceiling. I screamed at the lady that we had to move quickly or we would die. I was terrified but jumped, barely making it to the platform and she was screaming in fear. I tried to coax her towards me but the ropes of the platform started to wear down so I had to move fast. I went ahead without looking back at her and making it across the platform to safe steady floor thinking I'd have to save myself first, hoping she'd make it too. I thought she died but then she was next to me, giving me some relief. \n\nWe went through glass doors and entered a regular corporate floor as if the scene before never happened. People were walking around working. Nobody looked as if it was strange. It was really high up too. I saw a stairwell leading down which I followed where I found two doors as if it was a movie theater, went inside but it was empty. When I backed out I found more stairs spiraling down, they got really tight at one point as if nobody was meant to walk them and nobody seemed to notice them either. \n\nThen I randomly ran into my best friend, who was happy and told me everything was fine, nothing to worry about and he was happily at work. He lead me through a hallway and offices. They reminded me of a mix between high school and uni, vague places I've been before. I saw people at desks working whom I recognized to be the people from my friend his internship, a theater production company - I know their faces because I worked with them a couple years back when I did catering for one of their plays 4 nights a week for 2 months. They didn't notice me and I didn't want to bother them with their work so I walked further. My friend said he had to get back to work so I went on ahead by myself. \n\nThen suddenly I noticed all this time the lady had been following me. I recalled her mentioning things like a vague voice in the background but it didn't click until I actually saw her next to me. I don't know what she said exactly though. Went down more stairs and eventually I got back on the ground floor as if nothing had happened. I went outside, the sun was shining and then it ended."

In the middle of it we heard a noise, obviously it was my girlfriend, there was no time to get dressed or pretend anything. My girlfriend was crying and shouting, she looked much more hurt than Ive ever seen her in real life, and her sister was like she didn't care much, an attitude like saying \"oh well, what r u gonna do? What's done its done\" and kind of laughing about the whole thing. \n\nAny comments? Thanks"

    "body": "In this dream, I was immersed in some sort of video game adventure. I was a Gandalf/sorcerer type figure. I entered a dungeon. At some point I unlocked a small room with a key, wherein there was a German shepherd sized black cat I needed to kill. I knew I had to kill it, but I had a hard time doing so. I was supposed to whack it with a stick, but every time it charged me I was never able to fully extend the range of my attack to deliver a killing blow. I only managed to half ass some weak strikes on its head. Fear and compassion got in the eay of me using my full strength on it. However this ultimately was still enough. I had debilitated the cat, it was now flailing around since I had clearly caused it some brain damage. I walked up to it and finished it off by strangling it, and then I saw it go to some kind of animal heaven\n\nIn this dream I was very reluctant to kill this animal, but I knew I had to as well. It was necessary for me to move on with my adventure. I had a hard time doing it but I eventually managed.\n\nWhat could this mean?"

    "body": "I've been having this dream several nights a week for nearly a month. It's actually causing me to lose sleep.\n\nIt's essentially my ex and I spending the day together. I wake up to a text good morning from him. I shower and get ready, he picks me up, we go get breakfast tacos. We go to an outdoor mall and walk around and window shop. There's hand holding, hugs, and little kisses sprinkled throughout this interaction, just regular PDA stuff. He drops me off and I study/do homework until he texts that he's gotten home safe. I text back some variation of \"ok, i love you\" and he responds similarly. Some time passes and at night he facetimes me. We talk in bed until we fall asleep on the phone. \n\nThen the dream ends, and I wake up shaking and paranoid. I know this all sounds sweet and idyllic but the entire time I feel intense dread. I'm stiff and tense throughout the dream and he definitely picks up on it but doesn't comment.\n\nI'd like to note that the details of the dream change a little each time but it's mostly what I have described.\n\nI had something of a traumatic breakup with him, but it was almost a year ago and I haven't spoken to him or of him sense, and I even took measures to get rid of any reminders of him as a sort of cleansing. \n\nI haven't had any dreams of him since the breakup and I want this to go away. The experience is excruciating and painful, and I want it to stop so I'm hoping any interpretations will help.\n\nThanks and feel free to ask any questions."

I thought for sure I woke up from that because everything in the room was the exact same as when I fell asleep (night light, order of the throw pillows piled beside the bed) and a tall man in a grey suit walked in while she was sleeping beside of me and grabbed my arm and started pulling me out of the bed and I yelled ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going, I‚Äôm not ready‚Äù so guy let‚Äôs go and I fell half way off the bed but caught myself on the pile of pillows then scrambled to hold onto my girlfriend. At that time he starts walking away and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll take her instead‚Äù so I held my girlfriend tight and screamed ‚Äúno‚Äù which actually woke me up just to be in the same position as when I went to sleep. Now the part that scares me is that her mom woke us up in the morning and had us come downstairs to see that her cat had unexpectedly passed away overnight. Was I supposed to die that night but they took her cat instead of me? Was it all a coincidence? Do I need to see a shrink or a priest? I can‚Äôt bring myself to tell her about it, but I have a terrible feeling whenever I‚Äôm at her house since then. The worst part is when I woke up my arm felt like it had been pulled on."

Then she asked if I like him or something and I pretended I just needed his tutoring, she said ok and took me to him. \n\nHe was with other girls but he looked at me at first uncomfortable then shocked then he seemed kind of happy. he took my hand and said it could be used for his science experiment since it was so dirty. but then he acted as if he missed me and even said \"I miss you, I've been looking for you everywhere\" and it seemed genuine. then I had some realization I was dreaming and woke up."

But in this dream I was kidnapped and there was another girl there.  Only she was about 10/12yrs old, short dirty blonde hair with at home highlights. Was about 4' 7\" and roughly 90lbs. Very obviously not well cared for. Very dirty. I was my current age of 23. But we were out in the woods in a trailer home with a basement. We got a lot of packages, like Amazon type stuff and for whatever reason, I was allowed to sign for them. And one of the times that I went to sign for a package, it had my signature already. Obviously confused I looked at the mailman and she told me to sign next to it. So I did and it was identical. She asked if I was *my name* and I said yes. She told me to go with her and I refused at first cause of the little girl and I needed to save her. Well she forced me away and took me a hospital where I saw my mom and daughter again. I said I had to go back and save the girl. The police said they would work with me and help get her out safely. Now I'm not sure why we couldn't save her when I was saved. But we went back I saw her again and tried to get her and our captors came back and trapped us again in the dark.. I woke up at that pointbut now that im awake i described how she looked to my partner, I realize that younger girl, was me. Everything was identical to how I looked at that age. I'm not sure what that means, nothing I've searched helps or mentions younger self.. I'm very spiritual with angels. So I'm curious if there's something I'm supposed to understand about this dream, if so, what? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you."

    "body": "Tw:Blood\n\nSo, I keep having this weird dream about my left knee. I woke up in my bed and I was laying with some woman. It almost felt like she was interviewing me but I was laying on her. I had on a black business skirt and out of the blue she pointed to my leg and said \"What's that\" \nA small red dot appeared on my leg but looked like just a tiny bump. I said \"Oh it's just a pimple it's fine\"\n\nThe woman looked at me and said \"Could you please pop it?\" I was confused but reluctantly did. The pimple suddenly grew in size from the blood filling it making it almost the size of a American quarter if not larger. It finally popped and a thick stream of blood trickled down my leg. She told me to bandage it quickly because it could become infected. I got up, and she asked did I need help getting to my parents room. \"No no, I got it\" I told her. I in fact did not have it.\nAs soon as I closed the door I realized I was in my childhood home and tried dragging my leg to my parents room. The blood never touched the carpet and yet it still had blood coming. It kind of looked like as if someone had taken some red wine and popped a hole at the top and poured it slowly down my leg. Once I finally reached my parents room I knocked on the door and came in.\nI looked at my dad and asked for help. He looked at me confused then saw the blood. \"Your face is turning white. You're going to pass out\" He said as he got up from his bed slowly (For reference I am black so for my face to turn this white it was a bit. Weird. It wasn't white white you could still see the brown color of my skin but definitely pale.) \"NO no it's okay, tis just a flesh wound. All good\" (I only remember this because I laughed at it when I woke up)\n\nI hobbled to him and in the most ungraceful way possible almost fainted. My dad caught me and my mom yelled while my Aunt giggled to herself. My dad somehow caught me and my mom kept yelling \"Don't let her fall asleep. Don't let her fall asleep\" I was confused and just exhausted and cold. I remember slurring my words and saying \"No it's okay I'll just take like a 5 minute nap\"  My dad kept forcing me awake as  he tried to clean the wound. They finally got the bleeding to stop but did not bandage it. They told me to do it. I hobbled out of their room and accidentally collapsed. \n\nWhen I opened the door to my room, it revealed I was now outside of a mall. my friends yelled at me to catch up. I couldn't and some guy, who I don't remember but feels really familiar helped me. He paid attention during our mall visit every time I was collapsing. He also called me a dumb bitch whenever I didn't want to take a break from walking. When We left the mall we ended up down this weird street sewer lane concrete thingy. He looked back at me again and was gonna say something but my dumbass woke up."

I would love to hear your interpretations of the dream, even if you only have an idea of what some parts could mean.\n\nHere it is:\nI was in my classroom and my classmates were passing around a venemous snake for everyone to look at. They said we had to choke the snakes head to not get bitten. If you licked the head of the snake it would be very hot, this proved how venemous it was. I felt bad for the snake because it was about to die since everyone chocked it,  so i let it go. Then it bit my classmate and he died. But i didnt think about that because i was focused on catching a little mouse that i saw running around on the floor. But then the mouse got bit by the snake, and the mouse bit me. I got dizzy and it felt so real, i could really feel how sick i got and how i was completely out of it. I thought i was gonna die so i called 911 and they told me they couldnt help and i could call back after the weekend,so I got mad and clicked them. \n\nThen the dream kind of shifts. I was in a abandoned part of my school. It was a stairwell with a big grid you could climb up to the garret and the roof with. Now i was gonna go up to the garret with my friend and some unknown girl, and also a very tall man (about 2m). His skin was grey and he had black eyes, and also like knots all over his body. The only thing he wore was shorts. I dont remember me being afraid of him tho. Then we all climbed up. I saw this wall with names all over. At first i didnt get what it was but then i saw my aftername and 2021 written after.  I knew that was my uncle that died in 2021. So the wall had names written with everyone that died or was going to die. Then i saw my last name again but with a question mark after. I thought it meant i was about to die. Then i turned around to look at another wall. There was 4 names and they were all my exes. Suddenly they just disappeared, like they had never been there in the first place. Then the tall man told me im going to die now, and for some reason he pulled out the head of the snake. I looked at my phone to see what time i was going to die,and then i woke up."

What I feel about my own situation in life. Either the orca dies here or I die helping it. Something has to come to an end. \n\nI would appreciate any insight if you would like to share some of your thoughts. \n\nIt‚Äôs like I am the orca but also the observer. I want to help push myself out of my situation where I am hurting and don‚Äôt feel like I belong, but at the same time I am scared of a part of me and my life that has to ‚Äúdie‚Äù/come to an end (me being scared of helping the orca since it could kill me). \n\nI felt stuck both as the observer and the orcas aspect. Not feeling like I have the power to take myself out of the situation, and when I finally called for help (news) I got ignored. \n\nI felt held back by fear. \n\nI feel very touched and emotional by the dream still."

    "body": "In my dream I had gone to visit a farm of a person who came from abroad(Europe) to open up a farm in my country(India). Let's name him John. John was a man in his 50s or 60s. He used to raise a lot of cows in his farms here in India. I went to visit him and stay with him for a couple of days to learn about his journey, his farm, and his life in general. \n\n\nSo it was around evening when i reached him. After sometime I noticed that he lived alone there. We spoke for a while, he wanted to show me his farm and how he raised his cows. He was a man of few words but the way he spoke with a smile it was clear that he was passionate for his work. He also had a dog coloured black and white which was at the farm. \n\n\nIt wasn't completely dark that time so there was a jungle nearby, he wanted to take me there for a while. So he took an axe and gave me a dagger just in case we run into some wild animals. \n\n\nHe took for me a short trip to the jungle and then all a sudden we started to hear noises from the farm. So we ran towards the farm. We saw that it was a deer who was licking John's dog we saw earlier. We just stood there as it seemed calm. I don't know what came into the deer's mind, but suddenly the deer bit off the dog's head and separated it from it's body. I was in shock. John who was holding his axe in an instant drove it across the deer's head and split it in half. \n\n\nIt was a gruesome scene to watch. John then went on to clean his axe as if nothing happened. I kept staring at the dead deer  and I noticed 3 puppies near the deer which looked identical to the dog that was killed. So I asked John about those puppies and he told me that his dog gave birth to those puppies. \nAfter that the dream ended. \n\nI hope you enjoyed reading it :) \n\nIt would be great if you could help me interpret this dream."

    "body": "In my dreams that is. I have frequent dreams that I can either fly or breathe under water. But I have to develop the ability throughout the dream. It starts with jumping a little higher, floating back to the ground, then I can levitate, and then fly (and then higher/for longer)\n\nWith the breathing under water it starts with breath holding, and then I take tiny little breaths and holding those. And then I just end up being able to breathe like normal. I‚Äôll just spend the dream at the bottom of a pool (or other body of water). Kinda floating, near the bottom. \n\nAnd in both types of dreams I can FEEL that I‚Äôm flying- or levitating/floating (both in the air and under the water)\n\nThey just happen so often and I wonder if there‚Äôs any meaning behind those things. And how can I make it happen more? With the flying ones, the jumping/levitating I start doing without trying. It‚Äôs just like ‚Äòoh, I‚Äôm jumping‚Äô, and then I realize I can fly and I ‚Äòactively fly‚Äô, I realize I‚Äôm dreaming eventually. But I can‚Äôt control anything other than the flying part. Can‚Äôt control the setting or circumstances, can‚Äôt control other actions, it‚Äôs just transportation, basically. Sometimes I stop and fly so much the rest of the dream falls away and I‚Äôll just be flying over random things. Like the pyramids, once. By flying I mean it‚Äôs just me going through the air. No wings or flying vehicles. I just jump off the ground and off I go.\n\nAnd with the underwater breathing I can‚Äôt control if someone got in the water too, so I wouldn‚Äôt call it lucid. \n\nAnd even when I realize I‚Äôm dreaming, I can‚Äôt change anything or control anything (beyond ‚Äòoh, I‚Äôm distractedly flying), I can‚Äôt wake up from them. I‚Äôll be trapped in nightmares and know I‚Äôm dreaming, but I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôve even died in my dreams and it‚Äôll be like I was dead but ‚Äòwoke up‚Äô in the dream and went about the rest of the dream (as it would have played out, like I said, I have zero input or control)\n\nI guess worth mentioning is that I have SEVERE insomnia, I‚Äôm heavily medicated for it so dreams can be more intense. I also am on other meds that disrupt certain process, and those effect nightmares and those- there are just quite dark things in my head‚Ä¶so I understand this may be quite a wall to scale to interpret my dreams since they‚Äôre subject to quite a few variables. I‚Äôll repeated the questions I had, so it‚Äôs more concise:\n\nWhat could dreams about flying mean? I try to bring it on but it doesn‚Äôt always work. Or work properly. And I mean, I‚Äôm happy with these parts. I tried really hard to take control over my dreams, but that‚Äôs not a thing I can do. I can just fly away when I‚Äôve built up the flight skill. \n\nWill it ever, or can I trigger the process of ‚Äòlearning‚Äô to fly?\n\nWhat could the dreams where I spend my time just floating down below the water mean? I really enjoy the water dreams too. I‚Äôm comfortable (which is extra because I‚Äôm chronic pain patient. Pain wakes me up‚Ä¶except for the dreams I get stuck in. My brains decided it has a dream queued, and that I‚Äôll be following the script until the story has been acted out.)\n\nI also get nightmares so severe that I usually can‚Äôt wake up from, or it‚Äôll be one of those where my sense are obscured. Like the sun is always in my eyes. I can‚Äôt see anything and I just try to shield my yes with the shade in creates. Or here‚Äôs one I absolutely hate- I‚Äôll need to go somewhere. Like what if I escaped from some insane kller monster and I‚Äôm try to run and OH SHIT, I don‚Äôt have shoes. The bads either took them or they took me when I was barefoot. Effective anti-escape method for me lol. My brain tries to outsmart itself. I also feel pain in dreams, I‚Äôd I‚Äôve woken with injuries. None are serious. But there is nothing around that could explain it. \n\nSorry this became so long, lol. \n\nThis post was meant to ask what dreams of flying (and flying is a skill I have to level lol) could mean anything and why can‚Äôt do  right away\n\nSame question applies to the floating below water. \n\nAnd- how can i grab immediate control of my dream\n\nAlso the nightmare aspect- the being taken and held til they‚Äôre done (and yeah those words were a thing lol, that I couldn‚Äôt leave until I‚Äôd rescued people. It was intense\n\nIf you read this all, I thank you \n\nI know it‚Äôs a lot to ask, but the meaning behind flying and floating under water? I‚Äôd love to hear some interactions \n\nJust. If you have a minute. Thanks in advance and sleep well üò¥ I appreciate you‚Äôve taken the time to consider and that means a lot. \n\nSweet dreams, fellow travelers"

I was also very tired because I had stayed up late and my brain and body wasn't really functioning properly. When I got to school, the dream just skipped to the near end of the school day when I had my 5th period and I was walking to class and in the dream my school was a 6 story buildings (irl it's actually 3 stories)with classrooms and because I was so tired, I was walking to my class that was on the 3rd floor but I just didn't stop walking and I went to the tallest floor and found a door. also the tallest floor was where the least classes happened so there were barely any people. I went through a door and it was kinda like that scene in Deltarune where I walk through the door and the door just disappears behind me and I'm just in a room with a single desk in the middle of it, then some kid who looked like a year 7 walked in from somewhere and just started doing his own stuff in a work book. In the room I was in, there were 0 doors or windows and I was just so confused. then an older man who looked very similar to my old Japanese teacher, walked in and didn't question why I was there. I started panicking a lot because I had to get to my class so I asked the man if there was a way to get to S11 (that was where my class was) and he said that he could teach me a teleporting spell to get there so then he got some paper and drew some lines that overlapped each other to look like a circle, then he got some glass with a small circle panel of glass in the middle (that glass had a different and more clear texture) he told me to write where I wanted to go underneath the circle on the paper and look through the clear part of the glass and align the clear circle with the one on the paper in my line of sight. then some green aura shit happened and instantly went away and he was like \"oopsy daisy it didn't work haha\" so I tried again and it DIDN'T WORK so I started panicking again because my teacher was probably going to yell at me because I had missed about 20 minutes of the class by now. and the man was like \"let's practice taikwondo!\" and the boy at the table and him started practising taikwondo while I was trying to do the spell over and over but it never worked. Then I joined the taikwondo practice (i did Taikwondo 3 years ago and quit) and we all started having fun. then I remembered that i had probably missed the entire 5th period and I started crying.\nthat's when I woke up\nwhat does any of that even mean??"

It was probably day 1 and the new professor came in and said that to see our people skills, he needed to test us like in an interview. He asked all of us to assemble in another room that was a lot far away.\n\nSo we all went there. And we were required to remove our shoes. We were waiting for the professor to arrive. It turned out that the professor didn't come and we decided to leave for our home instead. While doing so, I realised that I was in the 2nd floor. So I was finding the downstairs. I met more of my friends whom I had not caught up with for a long time.\n\nI saw some sorcerrors casting spells and reciting rituals and ran away from them. Then I saw a disabled person harassing, probably sexually assaulting women in public to get some money for himself. I ran away from there too.\n\nI had finally found the downstairs and I got away with a friend. After walking a few steps, I realised I didn't have my shoes on. So I had to go in again. I managed to find my shoes but I had again lost the stairs. I got into a floor which had a lot of halls. I ran into a few of them to find the stairs. But there weren't. A guy stared at me. And I asked that am I in the second floor? And he said, no you're in the 3rd floor. I found a few workers and I was just about to ask them until someone called me and asked, \"Aren't you the writer of these books?\" (There was a bookstall nearby) and I said, \"You might have mistaken me for someone else. I'm sorry I'm not\" and then, he asked me to find a book. I did, and I left to ask the workers.\n\nThe workers showed me a lift. But they had to give access for the lift to work. They gave me the access to go, but when the lift opened, it was a small space shuttle. I somehow managed to fit inside. Magically, I was in the ground floor again. But my height had shrunk from 2.571 to 2.071 (don't remember the measurements units) (I'm probably 5'11 or 6 IRL) I found my friend and we left."

I put my foot in the water and a tiny little fish burrowed it's way under my skin, it didn't hurt and I was not scared, it started swimming under my skin on my foot. I cut a little hole and squeezed it out and it flipped onto the wharf. It looked like a regular ocean fish, nothing special, grey in colour with a pink stripe. It was the size of a grain of rice. I asked the man what it would be worth and he said it was super rare and worth thousands. I asked if the fish might be my grandma who died as I felt she was watching me and he said yes, and then pointed to a pray mantis that was sitting on a flower that was visible through a whole in the wharf, and he said \"see there's your grandad sitting watching her\". The little fish flopped and propelled it's self back into the ocean and swam away. \n\nWe started to leave when I saw a big shiny beautiful fish. It was pink and orange iridescent and was 10 feet long, it looked like an eel but had the face of a koi fish. I asked the man what that one was and he told me they called them coyotes.

He just laughed and said \"they're beautiful, but they're everywhere, we would get $10 at most, there's no point chasing that\" and then we left the wharf empty handed, but I felt ok. \n\nI have no idea what this means.

There are hundreds of people throughout the building color-coded by which floor they belong to, which the man explains is being organized by talents. He hands me a blue sweat suit, saying \"i think you're perfect for this floor, we're going to push you in particular to your limits.\" I took this as a shining compliment and motivation, not a scary intimidation. I don't remember what my particular talent was, but there was no audience, just tons of other performers being watched alongside me by the organizers. I remember it being a similar feeling to soccer try-outs I experienced as a kid/teenager, so i do know i was pushing myself, and that this was something i wanted so bad. When i finally got excused for a bathroom break, i was dripping in sweat and could barely walk- i was limping, even. As i was making my way to the blue floor's bathrooms, i saw they were all occupied, with other contenders sitting in a line for them. I realized this bathroom break was the only general break we had, and a limited time for it, so i decided heading to the bathroom on the red floor, which was a treacherous journey concerning my physical state. My body felt so painfully heavy. This was when the same man from the beginning rushed up to me announcing something along the lines of \"This is what we're looking for here- look at how hard she's worked!\" Which i say \"no, don't look at me. I'm dripping in sweat and exhausted.\" \nWhen i finally get to the vacant restrooms, my whole body felt as though it had been beaten up as i sit on the toilet. I couldn't even relieve myself/pee, i was just trying to rest. I heard others in the neighboring stalls crying, and conversations of some being found passed out in their stalls. For some reason, this motivated me even more to not burn out. As i was heading out of the bathroom to pick back up on my audition, i asked someone, \"what is all of this even for?\" To which he replied \"the circus, of course!\" \nI woke up expecting to be dripping in sweat, or needing to go to the restroom, but neither were true. I would usually assume these things are just signs of having a bad sleep, but i was physically well-rested. I would appreciate it so much if anyone knew what such a dream could symbolize."

I didn't dwell on it and proceeded to go to the living room where my youngest sister, mom, and second-to-last younger sister were eating.\n\nThen, my mom handed me a huge folded picture and said, \"It just arrived.\" I opened it and was confused to see a class picture. Our school doesn't normally do that. When I checked the lower part of the picture, it indicated that it was a grade 12 picture, even though I remember being only a grade 11 student.\n\nI asked my mom about this, and she laughed and said I was crazy or making up a story. I asked her about various things like how our research at school went or how my 18th birthday was, but for some reason, when I returned to reality, I forgot about those details. It felt like they were significant in the dream but got filtered out upon waking.\n\nMy youngest sister also seemed to have matured physically, and my second-to-last younger sister, who liked going out, was already working, which confused me because my mom said she was already 18 and it was fine. I asked my mom, \"Then how old am I now?\" She replied, \"You're 19, turning 20,\" even though my 2nd to the last younger sister, who was said to be a working student, has a significant age gap of around 3 to 4 years with me.\n\n\nI went to school and noticed many changes, especially in my school uniform and the people around me. I was unsure whether I was still in grade 12 or already in college. I suddenly realized that I had lost one and a half years of my memory.\n\nAs I walked around, I encountered a few familiar faces and then some classmates who were also my classmates in reality. They appeared more mature, and I asked them to accompany me because I had many questions. We were probably less than 10, and there were still a few unfamiliar faces who were new friends of my ex-classmates.\n\nI explained to them that I had woken up and couldn't remember what happened after I fell asleep while we were still working on our research. For some reason, one of my male group mates mentioned that our defense didn't go well, which confused me. I felt like it failed because I hadn't been able to attend the defense. I told them the whole story but it seems they did not believe me.\n\nI asked many questions, but just like what happened with my mom, the answers seemed filtered. I could see them talking, but the sound was muted.\n\nI checked my conversation with my classmates/friends on my phone and noticed that the way I replied to them was very different from my usual responses to many people. It felt as though someone had been using my body for a year.\n\nWhile I was wandering around trying to find my way to school, a moment of consciousness came to me, and I realized I was on a long, high, or upper round structure that was collapsing, with many people still on it. I was confused about what was happening but luckily, I managed to escape before the structure completely collapsed.\n\nIn my dream, I was able to dream within my dream, which made it confusing. It felt like the dreams of my dream self and my actual self had merged, making me confused.\n\n\n\n------\nCan u tell me what does it mean? I've been dream continuously every night these past weeks until last month whete i couldn't have any dream at all."

That I'm in the elevator, and usually it's full of people, they all get out when they get to their floor and others come in, but it NEVER stops on my floor! Until I eventually decide to get out and take the stairs...and every time I take the stairs I feel like I'm being followed and have seen some strange creatures (but not every time)\n\n2. That I'm walking into the woods, ALWAYS in the middle of the night...and again feel like I'm being followed. Sometimes I see rivers, bodies of water, etc, but not always! It's usually another pretty terrifying dream!\n\n3. That I'm on a bus or train, and again, it never stops at my station...it's usually crowed, people get off and get on...and I'm always just there.\n\nI always seem to be stuck, where ever I am. \nMaybe subconsciously I feel that way in real life l, but why the woods one?

    "body": "For the record, I have a good relationship with my family. In this dream, it's only my Husband, brother, and my Dad. We are at this really nice house, but idk why or how we were allowed to stay there. The surrounding area is infested with huge grizzley bears with their cubs. I noticed as we're going about our day that NO ONE will close any of the exterior doors or lock them up. I start to get really heated and yell at everyone to lock up the doors so the bears don't get in. My dad gaslights me and say \"you're overreacting, it's fine!\" My Husband and my Brother agree with him, and my husband tries to calm me down, but I just get more heated.\n\nWell, eventually the inevitable happens and the bears start to come in. They are aggressive and angry and try to kill us. I have to sneak around locking doors so more don't come in, but when I do, one of my family members leaves or enters and inevitably leaves the door wide open. Eventually, my brother leave and comes back with groceries and he's parked far away from the house. I get mad and ask why he thought it would be a good idea to park so far away from the house with bears closing in! It's not safe! Why didn't he just back up close to the porch? He looks at me like I'm stupid and says \"Well that's where you're suppose to park.\" \n\nWhile I'm helping unload groceries, a mom and her cubs gets between me and the house and I have to figure out a way to get around her so she doesn't see me as a threat to her or her cubs. I have do dive into bushes and really sneak around. When I get back in the house, all the doors are wide open again and the bears are everywhere.\n\nIt finally gets bad enough that my Dad grabs his rifle and I grab mine and we have to shoot them to keep them away. My gun kept jamming though, so I was getting really frustrated. Finally, I get it to work, but I can't hold it properly for some reason. Like, I'm not coordinated enough to hold it (which is ridiculous because it's my irl rifle and I shoot it just fine irl). \n\nFinally I can get a shot out and it only maimes one of the bears. This makes sense, because my rifle irl is not strong enough to take out a bear, but I was desperate and they were trying to kill us. The poor bear whines and is all pitiful. It's laying on the ground and really injured. It breaks my heart, so I try to go for the kill shot to put it out if it's misery and my gun jams again. I almost had an aneurysm. My dad had to give it the kill shot.\n\nEventually I wake up and I'm really heated. It's not the first time I've had a dream where I try to warn my family about danger and they ignore me or downplay the situation. Hell, I've had similar dreams about my co-workers not listening to my warnings or doing anything during a crisis. \nWhat does it mean???"

I was an unskilled labourer who was unfamiliar with the enviroment. There was often no path and we needed to wade through muddy water while fending off dangerous reptiles that would sneak up on us.\n\nThe water was infested with small crocodiles and these large dog sized lizards like creatures with sharp protruding teeth and thick crocodile like skin. The crew deterred them by striking them with sticks and didn't seem particulary worried by them. I however was unfamiliar and was very nervous. Somehow while defending myself I managed to grab a lizard creature from the water, holding it by the snout to keep its jaws closed. After some time it seemed to stop struggling and become friendly as i let it go and it would follow me around and would purr like a cat when i massaged the back of its neck.\n\nAs we continued through the swamp i realised we were there to escort a well dressed (noble?) lady, complete with a faded pink dress and white medieval head scarf, from a monastary deep in the swamp and to escort her to some unknown destination. To make the journey more difficult, she only.travelled inside a wooden horse drawn cart, filled with shelves or books. To get the cart through the more swampy parts of terrain required building makeshift tracks with planks of wood. \n\nDuring a particularly difficult swampy part of the journey while the crew were all frantically trying to move the cart of fend off the predatory fauna, i lose sight of my pet fanged lizard in the muddy waters. I put my hand into the water and move it around to try and attract its attention. However it missinterprets as prey (this bit is from the lizards perspective) and jumps out of the water to catch it, mid flight it realises its me and closes its jaws but one of its protruding fangs cuts along my extended arm and rips open my neck. Unsure if i died or survived."

So I first saw Sarah and then Charlie which made eye contact with and made me a beautiful smile, and I woke up. Since this dream I couldn't not think of her. There was something making me wondering what was going on. Then the second dream occured. I was in a classroom seating next to her, at her right, and she turned toward me, made a beautiful smile and touch my hands, and I felt love through me, something I had never felt in real life, then I was outside walking, and I saw her, she was seating on a bench and I was watching her from behind. It looks like she was waiting. And then I woke up. \n\nNow the context. The girl exist in real life, she was at my elementary school, but at that time I didn't fall in love with her. Since the elementary school I have never seen her. I told my best friend what does this dream mean and he told me MAYBE she was a soulmate. I  not sure if soulmate is real or not but, he told me MAYBE I needed to contact her.\n\nWhat I did is, I contacted her on her Instagram, told her who I was in case she remembered me. She answered, but she didn't make long messages. She said she didn't like to text people, so I thought I was annoying her so I apologize and said I wouldn't bother her, but she replied and said I was not bothering but she really didn't like to talk to people but would rather talk to them directly. Since I haven't spoken to her. \n\nI know this is long but, why do you think of the dream ? What should I do according to you ? If you want more information ask me in the comments I'll answer you !

I was able to sneak away and lock them all in the bathroom as it filled with water. Then I went up a very long marble staircase up to a roof top balcony and saw that it was now morning. On the balcony I found my partner there speaking with this old woman who is a coworker of mine. He was saying to her that he felt bad for not considering my needs and seemed like he sobered up a lot. And then the group of girls found me there saying they just wanted to talk. I told them I didn‚Äôt need to talk to them, and they said they were going to move away because of me.

    "body": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[An atheist asked 'Can God create a stone, which He cannot lift?'\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSwami  replied: Your question indicates that God is defined as omnipotent. In fact, we define God so. For example - Assume that we have given a  statement that a particular king can punish any citizen in his kingdom.  You may put the same question, 'Can that king punish a citizen, whom he cannot punish?' Anybody can understand that this question is meaningless based on crooked logic. Logic can be good or crooked. We should base all the questions and statements on good logic. Here, we have defined the king as omnipotent limited to a particular context in punishing any citizen existing in the kingdom. In such case, a citizen, who cannot be punished cannot exist in the kingdom. A non-existent person cannot become the basis of your question.\n\n Similarly, any stone created by God must be lifted by God to prove that God is omnipotent. In such case, a stone that cannot be lifted by God should be created by somebody other than God. Since God alone is the creator of this entire universe, this possibility cannot exist. Since God could not create a stone that cannot be lifted by Him, the omnipotence of God is contradicted. If God creates a stone that cannot be lifted by Him, the inability of God to lift such a stone also contradicts the omnipotence of God. This is called as mutual contradiction (Anyonya Vyaaghaata) in logic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuch a mutual contradiction does not exist by itself since it is created by your crooked intelligence only. When your question is based on good logic and the answer given by us is based on crooked logic, then, you can criticize us. Now, the situation is reverse and we have to criticize your crooked logic only. The reason is that the mutual contradiction is created already by yourself in your question itself and such mutual contradiction is not created by us in our answer. Hence, there is no need of giving defectless answer to a defective question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n If you still insist, we can give the answer based on the same mutual contradiction. You should not find fault with the mutual contradiction existing in our answer since your question also contains the same defect.The suitable answer for your question is: God can create a stone that cannot  be lifted by Him and God can lift any stone. You have to satisfy with our defective answer for your defective question. The blind bride should  be married with the blind bridegroom. You cannot point out at the blindness of the bride or groom since both are blind. The answer without  any defect for your defectless question like 'Can God create a stone that cannot be lifted by any living being other than Him?' would be that God can create any stone that cannot be lifted by any other living being. The human beings also create a house, but, such house cannot be lifted by the same human beings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTherefore, the human being is not omnipotent. Since God is omnipotent such type of possibility will not arise in the case of God. Lord Krishna, God in human form, created this entire universe, which contains Govardhana Mountain. This mountain was lifted by God Krishna, which cannot be lifted by any other human being. Therefore, we say that Krishna is God in human form whereas other human beings are not God. Hence, we should base the subject of philosophy related to God on good logic, which is scientific and systematic without defects like mutual contradiction, ad-infinitum etc.The example for ad-infinitum is that an endless chain is created in statements like 'which is the cause for God?' In the analysis of creation, you may go on stating the cause for every cause. You may say that the cause for earth is water. The cause for water is fire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cause for fire is air. The cause for air is space. The cause for space is God (Atmana Aakashah... Veda). You should stop at a particular cause, which has no cause. If you go on giving cause to every cause, the chain will never end. Such a defect is called as ad-infinitum (Anavasthaa). To remove this defect, we have to stop at some cause, which is called as the ultimate cause i.e., the God. Hence, the subject of philosophy (Vedanta) should be always based on good logic (Sat tarka) only. Shankara told this point that bad crooked logic should be stopped and good logic should be followed in any discussion (Dustarkah suviramyataam shrutimatah tarkonu sandhiyataam...)."

During one community gathering, he realized that he can do whatever he wants, so he took a log and decided to escape this place.

I heard thuds and a hissing-like sound and then an aligator attecked us. It was more of a tension dream than gore and horror. I awoke from that before anyrhing tragic happened.\n\nThis time I awoke around 4am and couldn't go back to sleep. Basically, my fsther was cutting grass outside. I was in my room so I didn't see anything go down. Heard my grandmother calling my name. I knew something bad happened, I knew my dad died.

A leg torn off, veushed skull, degloved skin ripped of arm. We dropped his parts in a basket that I presumably carried inside after.

I knew I couldn‚Äôt fix him. Him and his family felt like my family, so it was tough. I broke it off with him when I was 19 and in response he was full of threats and throwing many cuss words and derogatory names at me, as he always did during the lows. I am 29 now. For the last year, I have had recurring dreams of him and me being together during the good times when we were young and happy. Always the same age. We will go on different adventures and laugh and have fun and never fight. \n\nI‚Äôve been with my now partner for almost 10 years and I love him. I don‚Äôt think about my first long-term boyfriend during my waking hours like ever unless he‚Äôs physically in my presence. He is around me from time to time because he is part of our childhood friend group. He looks different now and acts different- he‚Äôs more outgoing and levelheaded now since his brother‚Äôs suicide 8 years ago. Anyways, he feels like an entirely different person to me now. I don‚Äôt miss him. I don‚Äôt miss who he is now. I don‚Äôt know him. \n\nAll of my dreams are very vivid and feel real. Sometimes I lucid dream, but never in this recurring dream. I wake up from these dreams so disoriented and have to take a while to acclimate to reality. I wish I knew what my subconscious needed, so I could stop having these dreams"

She got some coffee in the next room and we spoke through the wall.\n\nIn real life, I've got no clue how you butcher an animal, so dream me just removed not only most of the skin and the organs, but also started taking out bones, most notably all vertebrae.

It calmly looked around for a while, sighed and then closed them again.\n\nMe and my mom freaked out because there was no way the horse could be alive, let alone conscious, but if it was, it's got to be in absolute agony. Mom ran away and I struggled to get a knife through it's brain as quickly as I could. It had a very weirdly shaped skull on the inside. The horse showed no further signs of life during or after this.\n\nMom was calling me a monster from the other room and I was trying to convince her that I didn't and couldn't know.

The first 10 were traumatic nightmares and the 11th dream felt like euphoric bliss. I haven‚Äôt had a single dream since and it‚Äôs been about a week. \n\nDue to the deeply personal nature of the nightmares, I‚Äôve reduced them to the fears they represent:\n1. Being used\n2. Losing my parents\n3. Being sexually assaulted\n4. Choosing the wrong life partner\n5. Being trapped in an unhealthy relationship\n6. Losing my head (literally and figuratively)\n7. Being rejected \n8. Becoming unsightly\n9. Being embarrassed publicly \n10. Relapsing and needing my parents to help me pick up the pieces of my life\n\n(Context) I started dating someone recently and I‚Äôm feeling things I haven‚Äôt felt in a long time. All signs indicate this could be the beginning of something really special. Here‚Äôs my anti-nightmare:\n\n11. He &amp; I are preparing for our upcoming date. We run into each other 3 times around town. The 3rd time we bump into each other is in a grocery store. We lock eyes while we‚Äôre walking down the aisle and I see he has 2 Costco-sized flats full of groceries for us. I‚Äôm flooded with the sense that he understands and cares for me deeply (I hate grocery shopping and acts of service is one of my top love languages). He embraces me, reassures me, picks me up and spins me around. As we‚Äôre spinning, the grocery store fades into a pale blue ether and suddenly we are in the sky. My entire being is filled with a sense of anti-gravity euphoria. \n\nWhen I woke up I cried, partially from the relief of not having another nightmare and partially from how inexplicably pure and beautiful those final moments of the dream felt. I haven‚Äôt had a single bad dream since and it‚Äôs been about a week. \n\nWhat would you make of it if you were me? Is it a green light for the new guy in my life, or does he represent my hope for a healthy relationship? I‚Äôm open to any and all interpretations. \n\nSide Note: The number of dreams, 11, is significant to me. I have a tattoo of 11:11 on my ribs in memory of my ex-boyfriend who died of an overdose. Whenever I catch an 11:11, I always try to check in with God and say a little prayer. In essence, the number 11 to me represents God‚Äôs supplication. \n\nFor those who believe in a higher power, would you say it‚Äôs possible God may be supplying me with a healthy partner and loving relationship? I sure hope so."

I dreamed that she and I ran into each other and were visiting at her grandparents house. She and I were sitting on the couch next to each other talking. It was like we had never been apart.

And she basically wanted me to ‚Äúdie painfully, and slowly‚Äù. I sought out help with my brother and he was stab as he trying to figure out what was going on. In the dream, I called out for my younger sister so we could get help but i found her mangled in a room close to death. I ended up running to my neighbors house to seek help, but nobody could help me. I woke myself up when I felt like I was going to have to die.\n\n(My Reality)\n\nI‚Äôm a 20 year old female who lives with their mother and 3 siblings. I‚Äôm currently in the process of trying to move out (while in college) but it‚Äôs been very difficult as we all know it‚Äôs expensive to generally live.\n\nMe and my mom fell out back in 2022 as I was fed up with her abusing me in anyway, that she could find. CPS has been involved, family members have also been involved but from 13 until now I‚Äôve exhausted all my resources for help. \n\nSept 13th 2022.. I was 19 and told my mom firmly for the first time to not put her hands on me and she didn‚Äôt appreciate it.. not one bit. So you can imagine when I went to go get help from other people she basically denied anything that happened, even when there was witnesses. Even the people I would seek help from also have a hard time believing what me and my siblings say about my mom. \n\nI‚Äôve spoken to my mom since that day but it‚Äôs been nothing but her bashing me and telling me that I am ruining her life. Like I really can‚Äôt hold a conversation with her without yelling being involved.\n\nI‚Äôve been to therapy and I have ways I use to help myself mentally relax and escape my stress. Therapy actually helped me realize that the absence of my father wasn‚Äôt my source of anxiety and depression. It was really my mom.\n\nI‚Äôve experienced an awful amount of abuse and trauma from her. My siblings have all experienced some type of abuse but i can only speak for myself as I was the only one that experienced my mother physically. But like I said from 13 up until 19 I‚Äôve experienced some type of abuse. I was gaslighted into believing it was just discipline but giving a child a black eye isn‚Äôt.. \n\nI won‚Äôt go into much detail as it can be triggering for someone but I‚Äôve also been raped, molested, and sexually assaulted.. and each time I tried to speak about it to my mom, I would be ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù for it especially when it came to the men she brought around. \n\nMy reality isn‚Äôt the worst but it‚Äôs something that hurts, I can admit. However, I‚Äôm just trying to move forward with my life and get myself in a better position. Yet, these dreams man‚Ä¶\n\nThis is probably the third or fourth dream I‚Äôve had from April of this year until now that‚Äôs displayed to me my mom trying to murder me. I have no idea what this means but considering what I‚Äôve been through with her maybe it‚Äôs my subconscious, trying to talk to me? However, the consistency of experience this type of dream is very exhausting as I don‚Äôt want to go to sleep anymore and I can‚Äôt sleep by myself sometimes."

The room wasn't completely dark, it was partially lit by one of those old low quality yellow basement lights. In this room were three distinct things, a concrete beam in the middle of it, the lower half of a plastic bottle to catch water droplets that were dripping from the ceiling that was pretty low and one of those old wooden chairs facing the beam. For some reason I can't explain, I felt this otherwordly sense of dread and terror, I was almost having a panic attack, I felt my heart racing, was developing tunnel vision, my throat drying up and my eyes popping out of my head just looking at this room. The rest of the dream i do not remember, just this part. I've been thinking about this dream the whole day and I still do not understand why I felt this primal level of terror just looking at this room, I don't know why but I'm positive that it was supernatural."

    "body": "**Some background:** He was a poor communicator unless we were in person and would constantly let me down, \"forget\" or go back on promises made. It was clear he didn't care or couldn't be bothered with me if i got too much for him i guess. I'd just be ignored until i waited long enough for him to reply or i essentially,  blew up his phone. which was usually what happened. I'd vent my frustrations, try to distance, ghost him even but he would act hurt by those actions and want me to \"come back\" to the friendship but never compromised on what i asked of him. Once he moved away, he didn't care about maintaining the friendship. It was rough but i eventually and finally removed him and stuck to it. With that out of the way let's get to the dreams...\n\nI've had about 3 vivid dreams about him. To preface, I don't remember my dreams. Ever. (Aka i dont dream) but whenever i wake up from a full rest and go back to sleep to catch some extra Zzz's, thats when i get the weirdest dreams like being young again with all my elementary class mates going through this maze like house while everyone is roasting/bullying me or trying to fight someone but my arms are like wet noodles no matter how hard i swing. I try to run away but im slower than a snail despite going full speed.\n\nWith him, the dreams were EXTREMELY WHOLESOME (he, irl is an antisocial loner who ill look you dead in the eye and walk away mid conversation if he doesn't know you and doesn't want to talk). The first one was last year so the memory has faded but the second one happened  a little over a month ago. I was in Laos and strangely i was there with the side of my family i dont like. It was a good time. Everyone was having fun on the beach, by the water etc. I went in to some sort of beach restaurant and i saw him from the corner of my eye but wasn't sure if he saw me, I avoided him and went back to my family. I see him walk by while im with them but this time we make eye contact. I don't acknowledge i just kind of act like i looked past him. I go back to the place where i first saw him (i think for food, idk its a dream lol) and he sees me again, eye contact again, but this time i smile but still look away. Next thing i know he's approaching me and he is in full uniform (Air force vet but was wearing a Marine uniform in my dream. Idk why) in front of me catching up with me and we end up just talking and walking along the beach and i eventually go my separate ways back to my family and then i wake up.\n\nThe reason i think im in Laos or even Vietnam at this time is because before i stopped talking to him, he was vacationing in one of these places which I also plan to go to for my own trip when im older. But I don't understand why i was having a good time with people I personally cutted out of my life.\n\nThe second dream i had today. Same situation of falling asleep again. I was with friends in this dream and we were having a good time (outside settingni believe. We were on a bench) then he appears and again, same old catching up but he's completely changed in physical appearance this time. He had outrageous ink and piercings and facial implants, grew his hair out longer than before had a whole different style too. It surprisingly didn't turn me away, i still found him easy on the eyes in the face. In this dream he was a lot more openly affectionate: hugs, sitting close, forehead kisses and just seeming like he changed but it was a maaaajor 180. All of these gestures I did not reciprocate or acknowledge. I just smiled and continue whatever i was doing.\n\nI guess what i want to know is, why am I having better-than-reality dreams about someone who I have long since cut off and want nothing to do with anymore? I genuinely dont miss him. He made me feel shitty about myself without even trying. And I went quite a long time (little over 3 months) without a thought or care or regard in the world about him. He is absolutely a chapter close. And yet my dreams make me feel like there's such a high possibility of us running in to each other again (there's not, i promise) if we do i will not act like everything is fine like i did last time. I will call him out and want answers if i ever have the displeasure of meeting him again. \n\nSo why the wholesome shit brain???"

I don't remember the exact chronology of my dream but parts of it, which I will try to restitute :\n ‚Ä¢I remember being inside a sort of narrow towel entirely made up of stairs. I was surrounded by a thick crowd of persons, and most of them climbed up, but for some reason, I decided to follow two women who were climbing down. I extirpated myself of the ascending group and walked behind the two women. They were tidyly dressed, and I had a sudden spike of feeling powerful and special walking in the steps of these two non-conforming and supposedly clever and upper-classed ladies. I instantly visualized in my mind's eye myself wearing the same clothes as theirs and imitating their assertive attitude, which made me feel superior. But as we were progressing down, the stairs got completely tangled. But when I say tangled, I really mean it. Some parts of it even were more scale-looking, it was a mess. One woman disappeared, and the other tried not to fall. Her look turned less classy, and I could finally see her face. She had an exagerated expression of fear, and seemed way more ordinary than I had thought earlier. Concerning me, I was afraid of losing control and falling, everything around me was flimsy and cracked.\n ‚Ä¢Later in the dream, I was back home. I saw my cat and advanced towards her, but I felt something different about her. When I approached her, I coud remove her skin and fur. My real cat smelt her, shocked, and I didn't know how to react. I was numb.\n\nWhat could it mean ??"

    "body": "I had this strange dream just now.  There was a large cat, maybe about 3 feet long from head to butt (not including her tail), that was following me. Her fur was a deep royal blue color. At first I thought it was the sun shining off of black fur, but it was actually a deep blue color which I found very strange.\n\nAnyway, she followed me throughout this small unknown town and I was a little nervous. She was a *very* large cat after all. When I turned to see where she was, she was right at my heels. She sat down, looked up at me with kindness in her eyes, and jumped! She jumped up into my arms. She let me hold her like you would a child on your hip.\n\nThe purring...oh, that deep peaceful purr that emanated from her. I felt that vibration on my chest and shoulder. It felt nice. I honestly was a little bummed that I woke up. I carried that cat through this town for a while.\n\nI stopped at a gas station, apparently my landlord owned it. I told the man that I was going to drop off my rent check but actually had forgotten it. He was okay with it, but was *very* nervous about my new friend, haha. \n\nAny idea what this deep royal blue colored cat means? She was as sweet as pie....she made me feel so comforted and loved. The vibrations of her purrs made me feel so at peace. This dream is definitely a nice change from the parade of nightmares I've had for the last few weeks. Any help would mean the world to me, thank you! üíú"

    "body": "About a month ago, I had a very strange and memorable dream about someone I‚Äôve only ever seen a few times in an old photograph, about 110 years old. The person in question, for whatever reason, did have a vague sort of familiarity to them, but I have not been able to place my finger on a relation to any person I‚Äôve met in my waking life. A few weeks after seeing the photo, I had pretty much not thought about it much at all, until I went to sleep on a Friday night, and had this dream. In the dream, I appeared on a dirt path running from left to right, with an old house directly in front of me. Everything in the dream was in black and white. The girl from the photo was standing in the doorway, and behind her, inside the house, was pure pitch blackness. When we saw each other, there was a moment of extreme elation between both of us, and we met each other on the porch of this house and hugged, both very happy to see each other. Like two old friends meeting after many years. The dream then skipped to what I thought was the inside of this house, sitting on an old style couch. We were sitting side by side, looking rigidly straight ahead. We never turned to look at each other, but I could see her also looking straight ahead in my peripheral vision. Ahead of me, I could see only a sparse wooden plank floor stretching on for about 15 feet, and then it faded to just darkness. I could not see the end of the room. For whatever reason, I became aware that we were unable to speak to each other, but we could sort of feel each others emotions, and we were surrounded by the most warm happy feeling, like just so happy to even exist next to each other. And then, she simply leaned over, and pushed her left cheek against my right cheek, and it was extremely surprising to me in the dream. I could feel every detail of her face. It was the most real and detailed physical sensation I‚Äôve ever had in a dream. She then simply pulled away without a word, and we continued to stare straight on into this darkness. The dream then skipped to us in a standing position, her directly in front of me with her back to me, and me with my hands on both of her shoulders from behind, still just looking straight ahead. I made note of how small and fragile her frame felt, too small for her, and it concerned me for a moment. She was shorter than me, coming up to about the bottom of my chin, and I could just make out the top and back of her head as we both looked forward. It then felt like she took me to a doorway, still in the same position as before, except now we were looking into a small ornate mirror on the wall inside this room. And we just stood there, staring at ourselves in this mirror, still surrounded by that same incredible warm feeling from before. She wore the slightest smirk on her face as we looked into the mirror, and I noted to myself that she was really pretty. And then it was over."

    "body": "Monday, May 22\n\nLast night I had a dream about me, a girl, and time travel\n\nSo it started off with me and my friends at a convention for our school or something. I'm guessing it was for jobs after high-school. Anyway, I was hanging out and I started talking to this girl named Maddison Duley. She was a popular girl at my school. After a little bit of talking, we snuck off to the shipping bay of the building we were in.(the building was kinda like a supermarket) After talking about us and what we like and just getting to know each other better, I leaned in to kiss her and it she was laying on the floor I was over top of her with my eyes facing her chin. She said \"No, we are not kissing upside down, come over here and kiss me normally\". We did and when I opened my eyes, I was back in my chair from a couple hours earlier. After the convention finished, I realized that I had the ability to time travel and I don't know how I got it. I went to my best friend Jesse and I said the following (his mom was taking us home) \"Jesse, so I have the ability to time travel, don't ask how, I don't know. Anyways, I was talking to a girl and I kissed her. I had her, you know? I got a girlfriend! But then I accidentally timetravelled mid kiss and now I'm worried I won't ever get her back!\" \"What do I do?\" Jesse said \"idk man, if you really want this girl then no offense to my mom but screw her and go get her\" to this I said \"thanks bro, I love you\" and ran off to go get her.\n\nI made it in the building and then got arrested by the in building police because of disorderly conduct because apparently I was making a ruckus by running around the building looking for Maddison. As I was sitting in this tiny silverish black cell, I saw two guards outside at a long control panel facing away from the cell sitting down. Outside the cell, there was another inmate named Hunter Bryd sitting at the control panel with the guards. Our outfits were teal btw. Anyways, I had enough and time traveled to get out of this but little did I know I traveled back to a few minutes before I kissed Maddison and this time travel sent me to the timeline where I kissed and disappeared from her. I unknowingly went looking for her and couldn't find her. I decided to go back to my cell and serve my short time there (about 2 hours). I saw that they didn't even know I was gone because the two guards and hunter were watching a movie on a projector. I served my last 10 minutes and walked out. I tore off the prison stuff and it had my normal cloths underneath. As I walked down this white hallway, I saw a senior I knew, Ella. She knew Maddison. I ran to her and asked her if she has seen Maddison. She said to come with her because she was the head of security cameras. As I walked into her room, Maddison came down the hallway crying. At that moment, I realized that I was back in my original timeline. I ran to Maddison and asked her what's wrong. She kept crying. I asked her if she wanted to go to a place more private to talk and she said yes. We walked to Ella's room because I knew Ella didn't mind. When we got in there, we laid on the bed and I tried to talk to her. She pushed me over on my back and tried to straddle me. She asked what I wanted and I said \"I want you to be my girlfriend.\" She seemed upset and confused by this. I assume it was because I didn't explain my sudden disappearance. She ran out crying and I chased after her. \n\nThat is all I remember from this dream."

    "body": "hi! i‚Äôm very curious what this dream symbolizes to y‚Äôall. \n\nlast night i had a dream involving one headless snake and two snakes with heads. the headless snake was wrapped in a sheet, but it was still very much alive. i don‚Äôt remember the full context of the dream, but i remember running past the headless snake. it was slithering very quickly along with me - not really chasing me, just going in the same direction as me. the front half of it was standing up straight and writhing all around while it was slithering. you couldn‚Äôt actually see that it was headless because the sheet was covering it, but i was just very aware that it had no head. there was a man running behind me. i knew him in my dream, but he isn‚Äôt actually someone i know in real life. he told me that the people we were running to meet had chopped off the snake‚Äôs head. i remember saying they shouldn‚Äôt have done that because the snake wasn‚Äôt even venomous. then at some point, we stumbled upon 2 more snakes that i think were rattlesnakes. we were all going in the same direction. \n\nnone of the snakes were trying to hurt us, and i don‚Äôt remember feeling scared of any of them. i just remember wanting to help fix the headless one. i have no idea where we running or who we were meeting or why. i really just remember this part about the snakes."

This wasn't abnormal as she always slept with us since she was a baby. \nI stopped in the doorway because floating above her was a giant eye. It was like it was scanning her or studying her. It wasn't harming her and I didn't feel scared at all. It floated above her looking at her, then looked over at me briefly, I was still standing in the doorway, and then went back to looking at her. Then I noticed my daughter's eyes were rolled back in her head, but again, I didn't feel anxiety like in a nightmare. It was very vivid and I woke up questioning if it had actually happened. \nSomeone interpreted this dream for me when I had it 10+ years ago, but I cant find the interpretation and wondered if I would get the same interpretation a second time too. \nDoes anyone know the meaning behind this dream? for my daughter and/or me?"

    "body": "Had an intense dream last night. I had a dream that my mom and I were going hiking, down this path that was very familiar to me. It stared out with us getting in inner tubes and floating down the river to get to the actual path. So we‚Äôre on the river and I remembered that there were alligators in this river, and as I was wondering to myself when alligator season starts, I looked down and saw one getting ready to chomp off my toe. Then another one comes up and tries to chomp off my other toe. Then there are two more behind those two waiting to get at me. I called for my mom, she realizes I‚Äôm stuck, pulls on my inner tube, and we float on down the river. \nSo now the river part of that journey is over, I go to start on the walking path, look up, see my mom is a little ways ahead. She waves and stops to wait for me. I wave, put my head down to continue the path, and when I get to where she was, she‚Äôs gone. I start calling for her and as I‚Äôm calling, I‚Äôm beginning to realize how heavily trafficked this path is. There‚Äôs people crawling everywhere (I am from a tourist town, and that was the setting for this dream) there was a little area off to the side that had small water pools, so I went over there, she was not there. I looked everywhere, kept screaming her name, nothing. \nSo eventually, a friend of mine from high school and her mom come out of their house (which was right off the path) because they could hear me yelling. So they tell me to come inside, I tell them what happened. They told me to call my dad and the police. Then I go outside,  desperately look for her one more time. I can‚Äôt find her so scream her name as loud as I can, I see the look of pity on my friend and her mom‚Äôs face, and then right as I‚Äôm waking up, I come to the realization that she either got abducted, or eaten by alligators because she didn‚Äôt know that she was supposed to look out for them. \n\nAnd a common thing that I kept saying and feeling was that it was literally like 5 minutes between when I looked up and waved at her, and when I got to where she was waving at me from. And how could she go missing in that short of a period of time?"

I stop to grab a single orange delphinium and continue on my way to school (now walking). \n\nMajor train tracks run through my hometown. As I was walking, ahead there was a stationary train about to depart. It was cargo toward the rear, two vagrants were train hopping. The train starts to leave, one gets on, the second throws his bag up but quickly the space to jump is too great and he misses it. \n\nSuddenly, I‚Äôm now on the train. In a passenger carriage. The dirty vagrants are next to me, the one who missed saunters in and sits down with his friends. We are moving quickly. We aren‚Äôt going to school, it doesn‚Äôt stop there like I thought it did. That‚Äôs ok I‚Äôll get off at the next stop. The next stop is somewhere unfamiliar to me. It‚Äôs high in mountains. We‚Äôve travelled through tunnels to get there. We pull into the station. It‚Äôs a dead-end, the last stop. I leave the train-station quickly because I feel anxious, I want to walk back to my hometown. \n\nI have to walk down the mountain. It‚Äôs a rocky ravine, it‚Äôs dangerous - like a goat-track and I‚Äôm scared. I have a sandwich with me and I don‚Äôt want to drop it over the side. There‚Äôs all sorts of hazards including slippery plastic on the track. Two 30-40yo women are coming up. They have sneakers on. I don‚Äôt. They‚Äôre better prepared than I am. They tell me that I‚Äôm going the wrong way. If I carry on, it‚Äôs a 3 hour journey to the next town (which is in the wrong direction I want to travel in). \n\nI look around to try and see landmarks. I‚Äôm confused because the landmarks keep changing. Now the ladies have told me where I am, I can orient myself. I‚Äôll have to go back up to the train-station to return to town after all, it‚Äôs the safest option. \n\nSo I‚Äôm climbing back up. All of a sudden there‚Äôs all these grandmas climbing toward the train station. I ask if they can hold my sandwich in their handbag so that I can climb up too. I‚Äôve removed the plastic from the ledge so that everyone can walk smoothly and won‚Äôt slip. The old lady directly behind me grudgingly puts my sandwich in her bag, but she wants to get past me. We take a couple steps before she hands my sandwich back and tells me that I better look after it if I want to get back. \n\nShe pulls out a map (it looks like the marauders map from Harry Potter, it‚Äôs a magic map) and it starts self-drawing to reveal the route the train took through the tunnels and mountains. It‚Äôs not at all the route I thought I was going. Now I‚Äôm going up to the train to catch it back to my hometown to start over. \n\nNote: I lived in two towns, one aged 0-14 and a second 14-18. This setting is the latter. I now (31) live overseas &amp; have for a decade. I was my current-age in this dream."

I honestly dont actually want to work because I feel like it's too early to commit but too late to be wasting time, maybe that's got something to do with this reoccuring dreams. I got my first job at sales on may 15 and that's the first time I dreamt of dying. \n\nMy dream goes like this, I was at my workplace just doing MS stuff then suddenly our store was getting robbed and i got hold at gunpoint. at that point my heart was pumping. i dont know why but i tried stealing the gun away but got shot in the head. my body heats up then i woke up. i dont remember every dreams but im most certain that every day i die in my dream, and each dream i die and wake up with my heart pumping and my body heating up. \n\nThen fast forward to may 27, i got a call from my boss that i am fired, im gonna be honest... i got fired because i have no motivation at work, or working in general so im both happy and relieved that i got fired. because i couldnt quit my job because of the paperwork that has been processed, if i quit then i will have problems with the government of labour or whatever, but if i get fired then i wouldnt have any problems at all. after all that i slept like a log and then it happens again, but this time ive got my dad with me. my dad was shot when i was driving him to his work, i panicked and just drove quickly to a nearest hospital. while carrying my dad to the hospital i looked back and got held at gunpoint, got shot at my legs then shot my ear. at that point i knew i was gonna die so i accepted it and then the final bullet came through my head. ghen everything goes black, i see a timer from 5&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1, then the timer goes zero. i knew i died, but what i felt was different, before my heart races and my body heats up but this time i felt like i am truly dead... then peaceful of darkness for a few seconds then my eyes slowly opens. then i realized i was dreaming and did not actually die, then i fall asleep again... i wasnt sure why but i knew i was dead but i wasnt. it mentally changed me... i dont know anymore"

I know what I seek In partner and stick to my standards, therefore I‚Äôve never had a serious long term committed relationship, even though I‚Äôve har countless prospects. I deeply desire to find true love and become a mother, and because of my isolation and my age I worry that it won‚Äôt happen."

Like so huge I can see it spinning in the atmosphere. But last night was different. I was in my house with my front door wide open. It was night and there was a howling wind along with bright flashing lights which I can only describe as looking like explosions of plasma or an aurora borealis. The weirdest part was I flicked as switch which was supposed to be the light for my porch. Instead it turned on the sun? Weird I know but once I turned it back off I saw multiple huge rocks heading towards us. And all of a sudden my grandmother appeared, who is still living, and she let out this huge expression of fear. The physical sensation of fear I felt was so great it woke me up.\n\nWhenever I have these dreams, something bad usually follows in my life. I think it‚Äôs because I fly out tomorrow to head back home and my anxiety when it comes to flying kicks in."

Without getting to much into the relationship it wasn‚Äôt very healthy and I was very unhappy. we tried ending on a amicable note and we expressed that maybe we could try being friends in the future but we went no contact and I‚Äôve been trying to move forward with my own life and let go. \n\nA few months ago I dreamt that we were in a school setting, which was odd because her and I didn‚Äôt go to the same school. In this dream she was sitting right in front of me turned away from me and it felt like both of us were mad at each other and we were trying our best to ignore each other. I kind of waved that dream off because I had had a few dreams about her   And I just chalked it up to residual feelings. \n\nLast night or this morning I had another dream about her and it was also in a school setting. This time we weren‚Äôt by each other but I kept seeing her amongst a other students. She was looking at me and she looked sad, and I felt like she wanted to come talk to me but she didn‚Äôt. In the dream I also felt like I wanted to talk to her but I didn‚Äôt and I walked to a different area where I couldn‚Äôt see her. Normally I wave ex dreams off as just my subconscious still holding onto things but I found it weird that I‚Äôve had two very similar dreams about her and they were both in a school setting with similar themes. I was looking into dream meanings and stumbled across this sub, would anyone have any insight on why my dreams seem to have the same theme? Thank you"

    "body": "Any help would be lovely and appreciated.\n\nSo the dream started with myself and my family being in this kind of compound (which I wouldn‚Äôt even know what that would be like) with was another massive family- potentially Italian I believe because there is a mob type vibe about it, not to stereotype- and we were all integrated, and my sister was sitting down and eating, and I went to go sit down next to her and eat as well. It was a little dingy in there, and it was very, very shot back; it was a massive room, full of all the same furniture (it all went together very well) and the family was mostly men. And I think the reason why we were there is because I started dating an Italian man with possibility of being the head, or soon to be, of his family‚Äôs mafia.\nMy sister, as old as we are, still likes to try and embarrass me IRL. She told me something along the lines of ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt sit down and eat, you‚Äôve already eaten and you at least need to dress nicer‚Äú but a little meaner and snarky. Mind you, I was the one that got us in with this family because of someone‚Äôs interest in me, someone who wants to potentially marry me thus introducing our families together, someone thinks highly of me enough to do this, they think I‚Äôm beautiful and worthy no matter what. \nSo, biting my tongue, I walked away and said nothing, even though I wanted more than anything to verbally lash out at her due to how deeply she hurt my feelings. I went to go find our mother to go sit with and just sit with because she has a tendency of taking my sister side‚Ä¶ So I knew I couldn‚Äôt vent to her about the situation, I just wanted to be around someone I knew and try to calm down. \n\nThe dream transitions.\n\nNow we‚Äôre outside the compound, and my sister wanted to take a carriage, and I suppose I was the only one that was allowed to drive it. She said ‚ÄúI want to go to the Galleria.‚Äù my response to that was, ‚ÄúHow on earth, do you expect us to go to the galleria in a horse-drawn carriage? It‚Äôll take forever!‚Äù Still I thought maybe I can appease her by taking a little short drive. So she told me to just use the white one. It‚Äôs a single person one and it‚Äôs just four of us (two being her small children), so I abide her request and go and try to retrieve the carriage; It was in a little barn above a pond, and once I went to go get it, it was just a re-purposed washer with wheels. üôÑ"

I have currently taken distance from her but still share mutual friends.\n\nThe dream itself:\nI lived in my parents house with my family. For some reason this childhood friend also lived with us. It started with a really childish argument about what fictional character we were allowed to like. She wanted to have one of mine I have had for a long time and didn't want to give her. She ended up getting so mad she cried about how unfair it was while wrestling with me. Then she left mad and even though she didn't really say anything I knew if I did anything that made her more mad something really bad would happen to me.\n\nI saw her again in the kitchen while making food for everyone and seeing me made her so mad that she straight up said she would stab me and kill me if I did anything else.

    "body": "\r  \n**What is the dream meaning of not wearing clothes?**\n\nDreaming of being naked has several meanings. All are reflections of the present mind of the dreamer. It could be a problem that has been reported and needs to be fixed, or it could just be a re-enactment of what the dreamer had in mind.\r  \n\r  \nMany people believe that dream interpretation is extremely necessary because it can give you omens about the past, present or future in study, work, health, love, etc.\r  \n\r  \nTo dream that you are naked indicates that you are deliberately running away. This dream also represents being shunned, hated, afraid of being ridiculed by others.\r  \n\r  \nIf you are in a new love and dream of being naked, this dream suggests that you are nervous or afraid to express your thoughts and feelings to that person.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, this is just one of the ways to interpret the dream of seeing yourself without clothes. Because in each dream, the circumstances, details and images appear different. Therefore, in order to know the most specific and accurate omens, we must interpret separately in each specific case.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream interpretation of not wearing clothes good or bad?**\r  \nAccording to experts, dreams involving naked people often reflect things related to all your relationships. Specifically, the dream owner will meet the market in the near future. Therefore, you need to pay more attention to every word, including yourself.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming of walking but not wearing clothes**\r  \nIn your dream, you see yourself walking through a crowd of people naked. What does this undressed dream imply? This dream shows that you are a person who is easily hurt or embarrassed in front of others.\n\n**&gt;&gt;&gt;See more:** [**https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/**](https://mu88.watch/mo-khong-mac-quan-ao/)\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being naked in the classroom, at work**\r  \nIf you dreamed that you were naked at work, in class, such a dream indicates that you are not really ready for a certain plan. You feel stressed and confused when making decisions, especially when the attention of many people makes this problem even more serious.\r  \n\r  \n**Dream of not wearing clothes but no one notices**\r  \nIf in your dream appears the image of you naked but no one notices or notices that. This dream shows that your fears are completely unfounded. You yearn for more people to notice you.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming about being proud of my nudes**\r  \nIf one day you dream that you are naked but completely proud and unashamed, it is a sign that you are a free spirit. You always feel proud of yourself and your mood is always comfortable and happy.\r  \n\r  \n**Dreaming that I was stripped of my clothes, without a piece of cloth to cover my body**\r  \nTo dream that you are stripped of your clothes, without a piece of cloth, indicates that you have recently been entangled in some bad things, many rumors are not good for you. They make you feel humiliated and ashamed. You feel scared and worried if you let other people know. What you need to do is stay calm so you can handle things."

After that happened I gave my keys to the person who wanted to drive my car and they then drove off in my car very fast and lost control of the car and crashed the car into the front gate. I was upset, but kept my emotions under control. They got out of my car and threw a hydro flash towards the car blaming the car for the accident rather than saying it was their fault.

The teacher was saying something and I remember giggling with a girl next to me about something. The teacher told me to please be quiet and said something else rude. I remember myself whispering to the girl next to me saying \"This bitch crazy.\" The teacher got furious and started yelling. I denied I said that to her.

I think I was having fun and was at peace. One of the studentss encouraged me to go back to classroom and apologize. She said her and a friend would come with me.

    "body": "So, this dream wasn't a nightmare since I (23m) wasn't really scared, but the way it all went was basically I dreamt of me getting something from my dad's car where he usually leaves his wallet or sometimes (in the case of my dream) his phone, so in the dream, while fetching his phone at night, I notice a couple walking down the street, the disfigured man and a tall lady (that looked like a night lady) that seem to be coming my way to which I react by entering quickly past my house's fence,, then they seem to pass by while obviously noticing what I did, then the small guy comes back and proceeds to enter my father's car because I forgot to lock it so I enter my house and lock my door while he starts to climb the fence to my house, I never think of calling the cops but I eventually open the door to my house and meet the guy at the middle of the staircase where I notice his face being disfigured on his left side and him being disguised as the green reaper but with a real size appropriate scythe to which he just smiles and hands me the phone I was fetching in the first place, then he leaves and forgets his scythe to which I respond with reluctantly going after him to give it back, just as he did with the phone and then he just leaves, then I call my dad's associate in hopes of my dad being with him to inform him I have the phone, my dad answers immediately, I notice the time on the phone is 12:00 am, he answers mad, I ask him what's wrong, he then informs me of how I left his wallet open and that he knows I've claimed he hasn't done anything for me ever, I'm doumbfounded since I've never touched his wallet for something like that, and irl I'm actually the one that stashes the cash whenever a big deal or payment comes around, then I wake up, but again I'm weirded out because as I said, my dad and I have an unspoken trust that he shares with none of my siblings nor with my mom or his wife, and despite knowing he's not perfect, I've always defended him even when it wasn't right just to cut him some slack with my siblings, (I'm the only one that lived with him), and even after he came to live with his wife to a home he left my mother when they divorced and my mother left to my oldest brother and me since she didn't want to do anything with it, even after I gave him all of my savings of 2 years of me working as a waiter and one working as a translator for his sister which needed financial aid for the last 5 years ( he also lent her about 600k, I lent her about 30k), so I was doumbfounded to hear him so mad for whatever I could've took from his wallet and the claim he was making. Recently we've been going through some financial issues but the last week we seem to be coming back, and I don't know what the meaning of this dream could be."

First person perspective, so I was experiencing everything.\n\nI was on a beautiful, endless meadow full of flowers. Nice temperatures, blue sky, no civilization in sight, sun was out, a mild and enjoyable summer day in nature in god knows where. \n\nFor some unknown reason I was running through the meadow, away from an agitated swarm of bees which chased me. Chasing and definitely touching my skin, but not attacking. Not a single sting, but I was still afraid of the bees and kept running, tried to keep my mouth closed to avoid swallowing bees and hoped none would end up in my eyes.\n\nThen I jumped into a small pond with crystal clear water to escape and looked up. From below I could see the swarm on the surface and it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I don't know if the swarm was big or if the bees hovered above the surface but it took a while. I was too afraid of the bees to emerge and started to struggle from lack of air but I still didn't want to dive upwards.\n\nDream ended with me inevitably floating towards the surface, eyes and mouth firmly closed."

(I don't have a twin in real life) Together we were walking down the road to go to college. (I don't go to college) There was a really bad accident at a roundabout we were crossing through, and one of the vehicles actually went up into the air, and landed partially on her. It was like something out of a Final Destination movie. Anyway, she went to the hospital in an ambulance, and while she was in the hospital, she died. The nurse accused me of murdering her, because she was apparently getting better. I left the hospital, crying and went to a restaurant across the street. I was too upset to eat, but my abusive ex wife came over to talk to me. She offered me a ride home, and I hesitantly accepted. Her passenger car door and window were both broken, and I had to stick my arm out the window and hold onto the door from the outside to keep it closed. I end up slicing my arm really bad, and she wouldn't take me to the hospital. She said it was for my own good, because I don't have health insurance. We got into a fight about it and she ended up leaving me in an alley, and while walking home, I passed out.

    "body": "Hi for some background context my dad has been dead since 2010. I was 9 when he passed so I've spent more of my life without him than I did with him, and the rest of my family has/had a much closer relationship to him. I always lived with my mother while he traveled for work and only visited us occasionally. I wasn't even a person, or I didn't feel in control of my actions yet when he passed away (by suicide). The manner of death has caused me to feel a kind of way and re-evaluate all the interactions I remember having with him which tend to skew negative. Like I feel guilty for not wanting to do something because maybe if I did he wouldn't have or I feel angry that he didn't try to see me grow up. Anyway I know that's not my fault but that is easier to say than it is to believe. \n\nI continue to have complicated feelings about it to this day, but basically today is his birthday and in a month will be the 13 year anniversary of his death. This may have stirred things up because I was keeping myself aware of it so that I could text my mom and offer comfort if she needed it. However, I've never had a dream directly about him before now. If anything, it was mentioned in passing or was implied, but I never had physically seen him in my dreams that I can remember. And since its been over a decade we don't really feel impacted by the anniversary unless its like a big one. \n\nNow onto the dream. In the dream I was myself as a child, probably around the age that he died and we were in a house I was unfamiliar with. So in my early childhood, my parents were off and on and in this dream my dad came home with a new girlfriend. She seemed nice enough and really supported him to the point of slightly disliking myself, my sister, and my mom. But this led to us not liking her all that much, so it was suggested that I scare her. I put on some three part black outfit, I couldn't tell what it was supposed to be and hid behind a door. When she opened it, I kinda hissed but I didn't get a reaction. Then I think one of them said they were going to take our cat (or I felt like it was implied that they were going to hurt it - which is not something he would do as a person but mirrors a situation where I thought he had cremated our cat when I was very young) so I was naturally very mad and upset. I grabbed the cat and ran into a bedroom, I did not see my dad for the remainder of the dream nor did he say anything else, but I remember that I suddenly felt the anger, sadness, and disappointment he felt about me and my actions. I started crying unconsolably for several minutes because it felt like he would never forgive me. \n\nThen it was like a hard cut to a school theatre play I was doing tech for (so random but I did do this in middle school). I thought he would come out to at least support me, but when I walked outside to find my parents after it was done, I only saw my mom. I began crying super hard again which is when my mom introduced me to some guy that I don't recognize from my real life. But again I had the feeling that he knew my dad and he was trying to console me by telling me about a similar situation he had been in or something. That's when I got a phone call and woke up, but I just feel super gross and really bad about the dream and would like to understand it. Is it just a manifestation of that scenario that actually happened or something deeper? Also like why now?"

I had bought a very old run down house with old furnishings etc still there, it looked to have been well lived in but completely abandoned with everything still there. It was like a maze too, so many rooms and floors. I was exploring the house and trying to do a bit of tidying up, when in one of the bathrooms I found a bath that was part of the structure, like an old Roman type bath maybe. I turned the water on to try and test it to make sure it actually worked, when water started flowing into the bath a massive bunch of spiders (huge spiders üò≥üò≥) came running out the wall attached to the bath. I freaked out and turned the water off, they ran back into the wall. Left the room and explored more, went into another room and found a large bunch of cats that were mostly feral but they were actually very healthy looking. Some of them were friendly, others were hissing at me, others were distant but curious. First thought was to call SSPCA as a bunch of abandoned cats, wanted them to be rescued and checked over by a vet. Went exploring a bit more and in another room I found a bunch of dogs, all pretty friendly thankfully and looking healthy. Then in another room I found a mixed bunch of cats and dogs with some rabbits in the mix, all very friendly and coexisting together peacefully and looking healthy. In this room there was also a good amount of those massive spiders on the wall. Very bizarre and has left me a bit confused"

So in this dream, I was myself as I am (20f) and I was the girlfriend of a famous singer (20m). I wont say who he is because none of you will know who he is and also its not really relevant. Now something about this singer, he‚Äôs the complete opposite of me and when they say opposites attract I used to never believe in that kind of stuff but for some time now I have been attracted to him like if he was a literal magnet. I am completely mesmerized. Because I am fascinated by his personality and lately I have learned a lot about myself even if it‚Äôs just from having on a crush on this guy. In the dream, it was the night of his concert, and I felt amazing. Let me tell you something about myself: I am very shy, serious, not the type to even enjoy a concert, but here in my dream I was having the time of my life! I felt safe and secure despite being in a large crowd. I felt an overwhelming amount of confidence which I have never experienced in real life. Then the singer (my boyfriend in my dream) took me backstage. And basically I just felt completely in love with him and he was obsessed and in love with me as well?!Again, this guy is very different from anyone I have ever felt interest in real life. And it‚Äôs not just because he‚Äôs famous or whatever, it‚Äôs because of his personality: his carefree laidback attitude, his ability to make friends easily, and the way he‚Äôs relaxed and easygoing about life is polar opposite from me. The dream ended when I began to realize I was dreaming. It ended off by him bringing me onto stage with him and introducing me to the crowd as his girlfriend. The crowd went wild and began screaming in excitement. And that‚Äôs the end. So can someone help me understand what this means?! I‚Äôm a girl who just stays at home reading books and never goes out at all, and suddenly I have the most intense realistic dream of my entire life where I am a rockstar‚Äôs girlfriend? Help Lol"

    "body": "LUCID, NIGHTMARE DREAM, ATTEMPTED MUDER \n\nDream lasted abt 2 hours I think. \nI start off at work and walking off the Main Street of an area in my city. I meet with some people i know and through them a meet a guy that works in my building. We start walking back to work and some guys goes running towards where we came from. We keep walking and a guy comes out from across the street with a crazed look and a bloody knife. The guy I‚Äôm with confronts him as I run away. Absolutely sprinting. I get onto the Main Street, a van pulls up, a guy gets out and somehow I escape. \n\nHere I have the opportunity to wake up out of the dream but I don‚Äôt take it. I know it‚Äôs a dream and I want to see where it goes. I am now in my office building bathroom with the guy I was originally with and another person. Outside in the hall we can hear the door open and we know it‚Äôs the guy with the knife. We walks into the bathroom and confronts me. The guy I‚Äôm with again tries to save me and in the process is stabbed and so is the other person. I manage to escape again. \n\nOutside my mom who is not my mom irl is there to pick me up along with 2 sisters who end up being left for some reason. We start driving, I tell her what happened and I call the cops. I ask if anyone‚Äôs reported anything and no one has and I start going into what I remember but it‚Äôs a dream and I can‚Äôt think of all the details. The line cuts and I wake up.

    "body": "I was in that vaguely familiar dreamspace with elements of my life, furniture and articles from my past etc. I was sitting on a barstool at a bar my dad built in our basement when I was a kid. A woman enters through a doorway, wearing a teal dress of intricate design and patterns, shiny with inlaid gems of blue, and takes a seat next to me. She holds out her hand and tells me to take it. I oblige and after a few seconds she asks if I could feel anything yet, and as I say no I felt our connection vibrate and glow blue and suddenly I am somewhere pitch black and confused. I feel a terrible presence enter and I crumble to the ground, trembling, and too afraid to look. I felt dirtier than ever before, and he chides me and tells me how minuscule and pathetic I looked. He said LOOK AT YOU, ARE YOU A COWARD? Pushing past the fear I muster \"I'm not a coward, I'm A FUCKING WARRIOR!\" And he says THEN GET UP AND START ACTING LIKE ONE! And I leapt up to my feet and bellowed a terrible roar as if to challenge heaven itself, my body ripped and muscles and veins bulging and a readiness to tear evil limb from limb. I realize no one is there, and I fade from that state of consciousness. I awaken on my back yet off the ground somewhere outside, a medium sized tree in the background, but I was surrounded by several figures. I didn't move. Only one of the figures looked human, like the ideal form of man but seemingly made of concrete. He wore a skull cap and trousers and a slight smirk. The rest I can hardly describe, but two of them in front of me looked vaguely humanoid, one had one eye and one had too many. They all held jars in their hands at center height. I start to fade out again as the figures close in around me with their jars and sticking my limbs in them and then I wake up on the barstool again next to the woman. She tells me I did well and I ask her who the statue man was, she said that was Adam. Then I woke up.\n\nHappened about a week before a beloved pet of mine died that helped pull me out of a downspiral, war experience had taken a toll on my humanity but he reminded me of just how human I still was. I took it better than I feared and expected. I only told my wife and a couple of friends, one was understanding and helpful  and one I think was weirded out and I lost contact with. Seems pretty straight forward but I figure I'd share it and see if anyone's had similar experiences or comments. Thanks for reading!"

Would appreciate any ideas concerning meaning and interpretations. \n- - -\nI was in my old school in performing school play. Filling in for someone who was sick. When it came time to perform I knew not where to go and where to be, making a complete fool of myself - I did not realize we were performing that day! After a brief interval I decide to make a better effort. I go out to take my seat for this lottery scene, as I do someone comes to me and says there is a bomb on stage. \n\nI take my place finding a jacket with my name on it. A woman leans over and starts to speak into a hidden tape recorder of the various items she finds and suspects might be linked to the bomb. But she forgets we are still onstage and so we both must pretend it‚Äôs part of the play. At this moment I open this letter on the table. This igniter slips from the letter and flies forward toward a book with a magnet. It starts glowing red. And I realize I‚Äôve activated the bomb. \nI stand up. Flip the table throwing the bomb away and yell ‚Äúrun‚Äù. I run for the door. People don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on. A few moments later people exit the theatre, the ambulance and police arrive. The bomb went off and ten people died. \n\nAfterwards I am felt with guilt. As I caused the death of these ten people by throwing the bomb away. As I am looking out the window I see these three men seated together outside. I can see on their faces that they are my enemies, they have something against me. I realise then that these men were the ones who carried out the bombing. A few moments later the police let them go and they escape."

    "body": "First post here, i am a 24 years old male, kinda introvert, there was something bugging me from years,since i have 7 years if i remember correctly, almost all my dreams take place in a Floating continent in Darkness, 3 times the size of earth,since i was little a LOT of my dreams takes place here, and is easy to know, because everytime i see the sky in my dream world is always black devoid of stars,there are only 2 smalls suns, a huge moon with a missing part in it,and a weird Red Star or glow in the darkness that only appear around  middle night, and if you get outside while the red star is glowing a lot of horrible creatures that looks like shadows from afar will appear all around the place,and it last for a hour if someone is outside,if all the people are inside buildings, the star will glow for 1 minute and disappear,so is safe to hide when that happens,describing my dream world perfectly is hard, because there is still a lot of places that i dont have reached yet, a simple description is a huge mass of land with a really tall spike mountains in the center, there are forest,plains,caves,swamps,deserts and really cold places, in the center,where the mountain is,there is a huge city in there,in one of my dreams i remember entering the capitol and there being a huge map of the world in there,a lot of places are unknown, there are varius cities and villages, and ruins too in the south east there is a village where you can reach a ocean,but the ocean from my dream world is weird,cause is alive,not like alive with fish and plants, the ocean itself is a sentient being, it will move around the continent from time to time,so the people living there settled around places were it tends to stop for at least 2 days, is full of life too, there are fish plants and the like but there is not ocean floor,only the void from below the continent. it can get agressive too if people hunt to much fish from it or when the red star is shining, so it will tend to destroy villages close to the cliff borders of the continent. the days are kinda normal,the sky is black but there is light from the suns,clouds and rains.but like in the earth where the atmosfere is blue that dont happen there,about the era of civilization is weird, some cities are modern,some are from the past, and there are no airplanes, or methods to travel in the sky, only cars,horses or being in the ocean when is moving around the continent. in one of the cities around north there is a huge bridge,is really long and big,people can cross it without problem, i have seen another continent in the other side,but i cant cross it,i have died already 3 times trying crossing it,the first i was shot by a robber,i could feel my blood flowing from my wound and the loss of my senses, when i died that time i was only 11 years old, so i got really scare,another time i was crossing in a car and around halfway the bridge huge shadow arms came from below the bridge and pushed me and others cars to the void, other time i tried again and before reaching on foot halfway the bridge the red star appeared and i got killed by the monsters, it was not painful lucky me,but up close they are hideous,they where decaying and not humanoid like,they where a deformity if you could say. after dying 3 times crossing i havent tried anymore,or at least,any more dreams close to that bridge havent appear anymore. i have die more times but in other places, one place is a part where there is a crater and inside that crater is a forest,in the middle is a lake with a perpetual tornado in it, i think i was around 8 years old when in a dream i died there,i could feel the tornado picking me up and throwing me really far away and before i crashed to the ground i woke up sweating.i remember a small urban zone in the top of the crater with grave holes empty and various persons around,they didnt say anything about the empty graves. in the city there are always a lot of persons,persons that i dont know or have seen in my life,they can talk,interact and have feelings,but when i ask about the other continent or about the weird red star they get dead silent and the surrounding too,they stop blinking and it gets creepy and unconfortable,so i tend to leave or change the topic quickly. is a extensive place, i dare say that i have explored only 10 or 20% of that place,and mostly cities,villages,forest or ruins.some ruins give me a bad vibe and a feeling that i should leave,one of the most impactful ruins i visited was a long passage around 2 cliff that was dark,in the wall there where various statues of persons really huge,they all where without head,only bodies,and they where tall like a 5 floor high building, in the end of the passage there was a big stone wall with bones and a broken door, inside that area there was thousands of giants bone arms reaching the sky from the ground, there was a heavy fog around and i got a feeling that i was being observed,in the middle there was something behind the fog that was looking me, i got chills and gose pumps around my body and something was telling me inside to run, so i did and in the passage i hear a creepy and chilly scream coming from there that woke me up scared and crying, it was around  when i was 10 or so  it gived me a scare.there is even more but it would be really long, what i want to know is,why i cant cross that bridge,and why the place is that weird?. oh and about the dreams that dont hapen in that place,they happen in earth and tends to be really cosmic like."

    "body": "I graduated from school recently. So in my dream I was also having a graduation, but it was on a cruise ship. The ship was deep into the sea when a tidal wave came and knocked the ship over. I was inside in my room when all this happened, but I had an aerial view of the disaster.\n\nI hit my head I fainted. It must‚Äôve been days later when I woke up. I could tell that I was deep deep in the ocean. I‚Äôve always been kind of a loner, so, when I got out of my cabin and looked everywhere, no one was there. The first few floors were completely flooded. I had no way to get out even if I wanted to. If I could get out where would I go? Even if I had special equipment, I doubt I would be able to make it. The pressure of the water would probably kill me first. Then it would likely be the nitrate bubbles from swimming upwards too fast. Even if I somehow made it up to the surface alright, I‚Äôd be lost in the middle of the sea. So I had no choice but just wait. I ate the food that was still okay to eat. \n\nI think I passed down in the dream. Because in the later parts, I had a swim outside the ship and get some food that was just outside. I work at a Bakery in real life and that‚Äôs the food that was there. Cakes and croissants that are just looking nasty from being underwater but I had to get them. One of the head chef‚Äôs for my job was there helping me."

    "body": "So to start off, I‚Äôm a 30-something male married to a 30-something female. I hardly ever remember my dreams. Like, ever. That‚Äôs why this is strange to me that I remember this one. In fact, during the dream, it felt so much like reality that when I woke up, I thought that I was dreaming.\n\nI‚Äôm not particularly proud of the dream, although I‚Äôm very curious of its meaning.\n\nThe dream: \nI don‚Äôt remember much about the setting now, the colors, etc. but I recall there being two sofas in a room. The room was relatively small, I‚Äôm thinking maybe 12-14 foot wide by 20 foot long, can‚Äôt remember the height though I feel like the ceilings were low. The space felt sort of cozy. On one of the sofas was my wife, alone‚Ä¶ she may have been sleeping there, can‚Äôt recall. On the other sofa was me and another female. I don‚Äôt recall a face (other than thinking she was gorgeous) or a name. The only thing I really remember is that she had tattoos that were very deep in meaning to her. One I was so intrigued about was on her upper chest. I can‚Äôt remember the subject matter in the tattoo now but I do remember that it was rectangle in shape and the subject matter existed inside of the rectangle. I almost feel like it was a cup or a kettle on a stove. I do remember the other tattoo, it was on her right hand and wrist, like ocean coral and shells. It was vibrant and detailed. I can recall a feeling in the dream. Like this other female was an acquaintance but we both felt something for each other while feeling like I was trying to be discreet about that with my wife directly across from us. I don‚Äôt recall doing anything necessarily inappropriate other than sitting extremely close. \n\nFurther context: I will admit, I‚Äôve felt lonely for a while now. My wife doesn‚Äôt come to bed with me and when she does, she never sleeps close to me or really acknowledges that I exist there. Sometimes I wake up when she‚Äôs getting into bed but I‚Äôll lay there with my eyes closed to see if she acknowledges me at all‚Ä¶ and no, she just lays there, turned the other way on her cellphone. She‚Äôs usually good otherwise, taking care of the kids, the house‚Ä¶ we have fun together, but it feels more like a roommate dynamic (even with our children) now rather than a marriage.\n\nCan anyone help to decipher this dream in some way? I probably wouldn‚Äôt really care if I remembered more of my dreams. I just find it quite odd that this is one I do remember. Thank you."

I ran into my parents there for some odd reason. This old but fashionable woman that I didn‚Äôt know approached me and complimented a fur coat I was wearing. I said thank you. Later I went back to my room to discover that the door was open. The old woman came out carrying another coat of mine, and offered to trade this fur vest in exchange for the other coat. I told her that I didn‚Äôt want the vest but she could just have the coat anyway since I didn‚Äôt really like it anyway. Throughout the beginning of the dream she kinda just kept popping up where I was and being super kind to me. Later I was just hanging in my hotel room and checked my bank balance and it was less than I‚Äôd thought but the statements were consistent with where I‚Äôd been so I figured I‚Äôd just spent more than I thought. My card was still in my wallet. I checked again later and my balance just kept dropping and dropping. I tried to freeze my account but my bank app kept loading. It felt like those dreams where you‚Äôre trying to run but it feels like you‚Äôre running through molasses. And I kept trying to freeze it just watching the balance drop not knowing what to do. I called the police but they told me I‚Äôd never get my money back even if I pressed charges.

My friend is there and we get in there together in this big hall.

Sure enough, it starts to make me float and I begin to protect myself by repeatedly saying ‚ÄúI am divinely protected‚Äù, but this entity is trying to silence me by muffling my words, and I have fight to speak and get the words out. I can feel that I am physically restrained when trying to speak too. I have to fight, and sincerely resist this force and cannot be overtaken by it.\n\nThis time, however I‚Äôm adding in the lines ‚ÄúI banish you back to hell from whence you came‚Äù ‚Äúbe gone‚Äù, and I recall the entity gets forced down a hall and into room, where the door shuts. I am still floating by force, and it seems another entity has showed up.\n\nI turned my attention to it and I keep doing the same thing‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve forgotten how it ends but I woke up.\n\n\nThe first time I had this dream of being forced into the air and was floating, it took place in some attic with high, vaulted ceilings, and the entity looked to be cloaked in black and was also floating. I had only been in that attic dreamscape once before, first time no entity present, and sometimes I go back to it and realize it‚Äôs not a good place to be &amp; will wake myself up.\n\nThe forced floating sensation, and being unable to speak feels real, I feel I am physically resisting something.\n\nBut yeah, I keep having these dreams and this last one was far more intense and too close of an interaction for my comfort. \n\nI am not a member of an organized religion, and this entity seems like it may be part of one."

The size of my room was much bigger then it actually is. Kinda like as if I was a toy in Toy Story. In the dream there were these vaudeville cartoons throughout the room. They were angry and distorted though. It was kinda like if you were to have a bad trip on acid. In the dream I was trying to figure out how to get out of the room. If I failed, the dream restarted. There was a point where I lucidly realized I need to wake up. But I didn‚Äôt wake up after many attempts. After that realization, lucidly I told myself I died in my sleep and woke up in hell. I started feeling my pulse getting faster and became more frantic in my efforts to wake up. I eventually woke up actually and felt my pulse because I was curious. It was very fast. Anyone have interpretations?"

It's been several months in which I've been dreaming about situations where I am treated disrespectfully or not fair in general. \nEither I'm being screamed at for something that isn't my fault or people expose me and my secrets and I'm very embarrassed about that.\nSometimes I even dream about sexual assault like being touched without consent or often raped too.\n\nThis leads to a point where I sometimes cry in my sleep because it gets so bad. \nA friend of mine I've spent a few nights with noticed that too.\nI usually wake up when I'm crying in my sleep but just keep on crying because of the depressing feeling in my body. Even though I don't know what the dream I just had was about.\n\nNow to me as a person: I would describe myself as a rather quiet but passionate person. I'm pretty happy in life and I don't feel like missing anything.\nI've had a rather hard past/youth. I've been though many years of depression and self harm. But nowadays I feel very happy and confident with me and my body. \nIn my opinion there's no reason for me to be dreaming about such bad things. \n\nOf course I've told my best friend about it and she told me to go deeper into that topic to find out what my subconscious wants to tell me.\nWell... I'm not that much into dream interpretation so I was thinking about getting some help/advice on here. \n\nI appreciate any kind of help and analysis. \nIf you have any questions about me and my dreams for further inspects, feel free to ask them! \n\nThanks in advance ‚ô°"

    "body": "I don't typically have vivid dreams, but this one stuck with me all day, enough to prompt me to post here to see what people think.\n\nIt started out with my husband and I just going about our normal day. We got a call from one of our friends (who it was is unknown, but the feeling was \"friend\") who let us know they had a dream that the world was about to end. \n\nWe looked online to see if there was anything going on, and basically there was a sudden countdown timer for, like, 5 minutes until doomsday. There wasn't any specific event that was predicted, just The End and everyone would die. \n\nI went through all the stages of grief in my dream in a very short time and before we knew it, my husband I were just holding each other waiting for The End (or not). I didnt think it would happen until my consciousness saw a massive red dust wave just whoosh across the planet (i was omniscient for a moment) in about 4 seconds, then i saw it over his shoulder coming for us, and then it was all black. \n\nThe next thing that happened is I was a thought, all encompassing, in the cosmos. I had no body, no form, just consciousness. I spoke to my husband there and also everyone else on earth who had died- we were all one with private conversations happening simultaneously. We thought, \"hey, this isn't so bad!\" Until a giant blackhole opened in the heart of the very universe itself and the universe started imploding. \n\nWe all watched as planets, stars, images of war, memes, ideas, everything material and not material that we know (but was MADE into an image being sucked in, it had a physical symbol, if that makes sense) was destroyed until the edges of the universe closed in on us like a pool of water going down a drain. \n\nNothingness. But obviously, I didn't know because I wasn't there. Next thing that happened, I woke up next to my husband and a similar day replayed- but I had given him a trinket during the 5 minute doomsday countdown, and he still had it with him so we remembered everything that had just happened and it was over. \n\nMy initial thoughts are stress, but I FELT so high, so free, so powerful being in the cosmos. It was a physical feeling in my body of just lightness. And the reborn, the symbolism, the trinket- it seems a bit deeper to me. \n\nThank you in advance!"

I‚Äôve tried psychedelics, DMT, etc. They came very close, but the elements are still found solely in my dreams. The feelings‚Ä¶ are simply indescribable. But they show that reality is halved and repressed.   \n\nSome of the only ways I can describe them, a sense filled me, I knew what was happening, it was so devastating and beautiful; I was being destroyed and reminded - all that was familiar, all reference points, all identity -- all viciously shattered and reformed in moments. I can‚Äôt even recognize the feelings, they‚Äôre unrecognizable - just a momentary glimpse of the other side, of the other feelings.  \n\nSo extreme and vivid, in one dream, on a roof on a building, again, reality is morphed, but still recognizable. I was with someone, it wasn‚Äôt love. The feeling, of everything. How our sociality confounded itself in this dream, how it linked together, the epitome - essence of it, you could feel it. So beautiful. They and I‚Ä¶ we knew each other. The aftertaste is so beautiful and vivid. So entrancing and consuming, it absorbs me with each phase of thought and every note. So inexplicable. I find myself enslaved but it, like a cleansing rain it washes over the me, this indescribable feeling. the most INTENSE feeling on this planet. I can taste the aftertaste, the glimpses are so beautiful, before it becomes lost to a black void I can only barely remember.  \n\nThe feelings, of equilibrium like in some of my dreams, in some dreams, it‚Äôs the strongest ever, Very vivid. The environment and it‚Äôs entirety plotted out in semblances of quintessence. The aftertaste lying in bed is one of the best feelings ever. When I woke up, I felt a longing, a desire for something that isn't possible. It‚Äôs so ecstatic. I felt a strange euphoria and happiness. I could taste the afterthought of the emotion, but couldn't connect it to an existing physical meaning like with normal emotions.  \n\nEvery second of my life I spend longing for the dreams, I oversleep so often, just hoping that the feelings return. I cry everyday‚Ä¶ the feelings are so powerful."

In the dream, it kept trying to bite me. Eventually, the rattlesnake's head was separated from its body. I think I might've had some type of sword/knife/stick that I was using to defend myself, and I may have slashed its head off in the dream, but I don't remember that happening. \n\nI continued to dream that, after I did this, the snake's body continued to lunge at me. The head, separate from the body, also kept moving toward me, somehow moving in a slithering motion, but also bouncing at times. I don't remember if I dreamt it bit me-- I believe in the dream that it either did, or came close. It kept flashing its fangs at me threateningly.\n\nSome context-- I'm a 26-year old male in a graduate program. Recently, I've been struggling after a friend of mine took their own life about a month ago. I wonder if the dream has anything to do with that. Another important piece of context is that I'm not really afraid of snakes. I'm terrified of spiders and scorpions, but I've always been fascinated by snakes (except for the gross muscle-y constrictor snakes) and don't have any type of phobia of them."

The puppy is lucky!‚Äù So that gave me the courage to help free the puppy from the alligator/crocodile. I told the other people I was with to help so they did.

One of my closest friends and someone I‚Äôve always loved.\n\nSomehow I instinctually knew that on some spiritual level we were (for a lack of a better term) both drawing the same energy.\n\nIf life was some magnetic axis, she and I are both north (or both south)\n\nBoth Yin or both Yang.\n\nAnd for this reason I knew that the two of us being together meant we were drawing in the same type of energy, making it positive, and the demonic force could never return because of this.\n\nThink of it like we‚Äôre slowly building up our ‚Äúki‚Äù and it‚Äôs acting like a force field.\n\nBut not just for stopping evil things but it felt like luck in general.\n\nLike somehow I knew my chances of random bad things happening like stubbing my toe or a tire blowing out all the way up to heart attacks would be lower\n\nAnd random good things like stumbling across a winning lottery ticket would be higher.\n\nI went to pay her some platonic compliment and I felt she took it the wrong way because she responded ‚ÄúI just need more time‚Äù as if she just recently divorced or lost her husband.\n\nAt this point the dream cuts to me walking into the house of a blonde girl that looks like a movie star I‚Äôve always admired, and when she looked her best too.\n\nShe took my hand and introduced me as her boyfriend which thrilled me.\n\nBut then it‚Äôs like a silent narrator just telepathically told me that despite how good she is (physically, mentally, emotionally) something about her (in an almost horoscope bullshit sort of way) meant she was on the other axis.\n\nNot even just neutral but one that would be negative and drain all that good juju I had built up earlier.\n\nRight then I knew if I stayed with her it would be constant misfortune. No chance at the lottery , if anything I‚Äôd get robbed randomly and lose money.\n\nNot because she‚Äôs bad in any way (I can‚Äôt emphasize that enough) but because she just brought bad luck.\n\nSo she tried to lead me up stairs , a moment I‚Äôve probably wished would happen with this actress in dreams for years but all I could think about was that the demon from earlier would pop out at any moment now.\n\nMy protection was gone and would soon become anti-protection (like a beacon for bad things)\n\nBut I wanted to stay with her anyway. \n\nAs I type this the meaning seems almost too obvious. The first girl is the right girl. But can it really be that simple?"

Rather than feeling threatened, I felt comfortable and safe instead. I was much older there, around mid-20s. Same for the man who seemed to be in his late 20s. There were stalls at the side and there are some people selling various things like the ones you can see when you go to a night market. Both of us were wearing pants and shirts and he has a clean cut of hair.

    "body": "Hello y'all,\n\nI had this really strange and creepy dream last night. For context: I (w) am in a loving, healthy and secure relationship. We are communicative, understanding and very much in love with each other. Everything feels great with my partner. We connect on every single level. I literally have no complaints whatsoever.\n\nWell.... but there was this dream. In my dream, I found out that my partner had been hiding some crucial information under her bed. I opened her laptop and took a look at some documents. I saw pictures of at least two women that she had killed by drugging them up. The pictures themselves weren't disturbing or violent, they were just normal ID pictures. But there were pills attached to the pictures (inside of little plastic bags) and I just KNEW that they were her victims.\nNext thing I see is my partner entering the room and I pretended to not have seen anything.\nI knew that she was planning to do the same with me eventually. It was her method of killing people: By entering relationships with them and making them feel safe and loved, not thinking anything bad of it all. \n\nI felt so disappointed and betrayed and also fearful..... when I woke up, I couldn't remember the dream at first, but then it hit me. And it's been haunting me the whole day now. I have no idea why I would dream such a thing. I'm not lying to you, I have ZERO negative feelings about my partner. I have no suspicions or anything. I trust her, I love her and I do not feel disappointed at all.\nYet, there was this dream and it felt so intensely negative and scary.\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nThanks for your responses."

I was walking from my childhood home to the bus stop where the school bus used to arrive. I can remember being frightened of the trees swaying and being afraid of them crashing down, but I still carried on walking. I can remember arriving at the bus stop and I realised I forgot something but I didn‚Äôt think it would be worth the hassle of walking home in these conditions to go home to collect it. Then I remember being in car and the road being blocked by a large fallen branch and having to take another route and I was hoping that no more trees would come down in the strong winds.\n\nI‚Äôve just remembered other dreams with similar themes of strong winds blowing power lines to the point that they could touch someone and electrocute them. I‚Äôve also had dreams of driving down roads near my childhood home when it‚Äôs windy and there‚Äôs lots of tree damage about. I‚Äôm certain this means something but I don‚Äôt know what? Google isn‚Äôt much help for dream interpretation because it feels like it doesn‚Äôt resonate with me. If anyone could help, I‚Äôd very much appreciate it."

    "body": "So I had a dream last night, I rarely dream unless a message Is trying to be brought to my attention. I cant determine what this dream would mean in all honesty, but last night the dream I had was about a pendant that a group of people and I found. Now I can‚Äôt remember ever seeing what the front of the pendant looked like, I just remember holding it up to others and seeing the back of it, getting an idea of what it looked like. But I have more of a feeling that the pendant was some kind of green color, and it had metal swirls around it, the pendant itself was circular. Now nothing ever happened to me when I held it, but I felt like I had to be it‚Äôs protector, it‚Äôs keeper, because I‚Äôm the hands of everyone else it gave off a really bad vibe of like evil, or angry energy coming off of it. When it was in the hands of those who touched it though, their faces kind of distorted. They went to like a weird shape and than back to a whole new constructed face. They didn‚Äôt look bad or anything, just unrecognizable and like they‚Äôre someone completely new. I‚Äôm the end of this dream I ripped the pendant out of someone‚Äôs hand and kept it myself and said I was gonna take the pendant and put it up in a clear frame, because of the energy the pendant was letting off. I dont know exactly what this dream was trying to communicate, but I know that something is trying to be told to me. When I dream all the time, I write down a lot of things and interpret different parts of my dreams and connect them all together to get to the bottom of the message."

    "body": "Last night I dreamt about being in a place that I‚Äôve dreamt of before, though it was quite a bit different than the last time I dreamt of it. It was a place that I knew to be a really big school with a lay-out too confusing for myself to know go to get around, so it was easy to get lost/lose my bearings. The first time I‚Äôve dreamt of the school, it was a good dream.\n\nAlthough it was a school and had classrooms and a lunch room, it also had multiple different apartment buildings in it. Each apartment had a different lay-out as well as having two ways to get in and out, each leading to a hallway with multiple doors leading to more apartments, or different school rooms. There WAS a way to eventually get outside, but at one outside area you needed a vehicle to bring out out and at another side it was completely fenced in. \n\nThere was a set of twins (male and female), each having their own sword. Their purpose of being there was to protect everyone. \nMy boyfriend (27m) and I (26f) were in a lunchroom, and he grabbed a couple of beverages out of the vending machine and drank them before leaving - I grabbed one beverage out of the vending machine, and before I could open it, the lights went out. \n\n(This next part starts to get kind of graphic, so possible TW)\nI used my phone for a flashlight and found my way out of the room into the hallway and then into an apartment-style room. There I saw the two twins and some other people, but something was corrupting the twins. The twins exchanged their swords with one another and started crying blood before cutting the side of the other‚Äôs neck just enough to bleed. Immediately after, the twins started killing everyone in the room - I was in a bit of shock, but then left the room to run into a different room.\n\nI could hear the door to the room the twins were in open and then close, so I kept running to find the door in the room to bring me into the next one away from them. It was also at this point that I somehow knew that my 5yo son was around somewhere as well, so I was also running to try and find him. \n\nThere was one room I ran into but couldn‚Äôt find the way out of the other side of it, so I hid in a closet. The twins came into the room, and while looking in the bathroom I ran out to a different one. I eventually ran into someone else that was hiding in a closet with my son - he was so terrified that he couldn‚Äôt make a sound but he looked like he was trying to scream - I think he thought I might have been the twins until he realized that it was me instead. \n\nUpon the realization, he clung to me. The woman that was hiding with him said she had found him hiding under a super low shelf - I then asked her if it was super obvious that he was hiding there and she said that she didn‚Äôt realize he was there until he came out once he realized that t was a safe person. I was relieved upon hearing that.\n\nWe knew that we had to keep going to stay ahead of the twins, so we looked for the other door that would lead out. I noticed in the closet there was a little bit of a platform higher up, so. Lifted my son up there, but he was scared saying ‚Äúno, no, no‚Äù - I reassured him we were all going to go together, but that he had to go first and I would follow and the seemed to do the trick.\n\nI went up next, and then the other woman followed. I realized there were dim lights on that we could not turn off and I was worried that we would be found from that alone if we stayed, so I looked around and noticed the closet went further down (but only in this upper part) and that there was a door on the other side. We all went through to find ourselves in another room. We went through quite a few more rooms before coming across one with a lot of other people inside. \n\nEveryone here seemed to be under the impression that they were safe, so they had music playing very loud and were hanging around like there wasn‚Äôt any danger lurking. I put my son up into the top of the closet as it had a deep upper part that went further than the  closet itself before going down and unplugging the music and telling them they were endangering everyone there. They told me to stfu and that they were fine, and then plugged the music back in. \n\nI went into the top of the closet but did not see my son - he was down below looking for me, so I grabbed him and brought him up with me. We then hid in the super far back near the door to the next room. Someone was pacing back and forth in that room, and I woke up as I was going to go through the door to talk to them."

The items emitted like a goo and some of my crystals were cracked and ‚Äúdried-up‚Äù or leaked a substance. Someone in the room had pulled four tarot cards and they were on the floor. \n\nOne was a night sky with stars dotted across - the stars were connected like a constellation.\n\nAnother was a cliff face with jagged rocks.\n\nThe third was a deity with an animals face as dark, shiny eyes.\n\nI don‚Äôt remember the fourth.\n\nI picked them up and went outside we ran into a tarot card reader. She didn‚Äôt want to read mine in my hand because it was bad luck or something wasn‚Äôt right since she didn‚Äôt pull the cards, so she pulled her own. \n\nThe first one she pulled was ‚Äúthe mimic.‚Äù when I pointed out ‚Äúthe mimic‚Ä¶ wouldn‚Äôt that be the same?‚Äù She was like ‚Äúhuh, I guess so‚Äù and became a bit uncomfortable.

    "body": "Last night, a portion of my dream was devoted to being cut in half.\n\nIf anyone is familiar with the series Chainsaw Man, I was taking the place of the main character Denji. I was running away from a threat with some allies in a metropolitan setting. The threat appeared to be a fairly normal looking young adult woman who appeared to have gone wild and enraged from stress. Her demeanor kind of matched how I've been wanting to vent my anger and frustration internally after how the last couple of years have left me feeling unfulfilled and completely alienated. I can place anger towards others, but I cannot place blame on them or myself for what has happened. I can't hate anyone over it.\n\nThe only thing abnormal about this woman was the immense strength she used with a knife to gruesomely cut diagonally through my torso and right arm, right on through to the person on my left as well. Both of us went down and I was very aware of the fact that my legs were no longer attached to my body.\n\nIn the moment, I was taking in how rough the wounds felt. The woman had mounted over my body to impale me a few, slow times. Despite this, I felt very calm and I did not actually feel in danger at all. It didn't feel like murder. My head on its side against cobblestone could look up to see the woman with a quivering expression of wild anger. Tears rolled down her cheeks, her eyes trying not to cry themselves shut. Strained giggles escaped her between sobs.\n\nI only really sensed a budding empathy for her. As the dream started to wrap up, I felt mostly calm and safe. I knew that in a dream, it was a safe space for these ugly emotions to come out. Though really, I don't got much of my own ideas for why I was cut in half, and I am curious to know what others think of this."

I remember what my MIL &amp; my FIL looked like down to their shoes. The conversations that were had, everything. My husband left to go to the store and was in an accident when my FIL showed up to tell me we had to talk about the kids, but that everything was okay and my husband would be back.

    "body": "Hello! I just found this sub after having some trouble deciphering a dream. I just had a dream where I was told by a wise, wizard type, that \"what you seek is the map\". Before I could question him further on what he meant, I woke up. I woke with the feeling that the statement was very significant. I have been trying to decipher what it means. Currently in many categories of my life (health, finances, emotional health etc.) there have been things I have been trying to pursue and I feel like I'm a bit lost and unsure of the proper paths to take for the outcomes I'm trying to achieve. Could he mean that I actually am on the right path and to just trust in that? But why would he call it the 'map' and not the 'way' if that's the case? To me, a map indicates directions to another destination. So could my goals actually be leading me to something else I should be pursuing? Anyone have any possible insight?\n\nEdit: Thanks everyone for your insightful posts! They have given me some things to ponder."

I remember falling after \"feeling\" it. Thinking about how I'm not dead, how my jaw is barely connected to my head and about how I couldn't move my body, when I fell after shooting myself in the middle of my head. I felt tense, I felt stuck, unable to do anything, struggling and suffering. Then I woke up after the agonizing dream I can still \"feel\" the bullets inside my head. It feels like my jaw barely works when in reality it works fine. Any ideas?"

    "body": "Last night I had a dream about my ex-girlfriend and I want to try using it to help me understand/process some of my feelings. For context: I am 26 years old, female, lesbian, my personality type is ENFJ, and I have borderline personality disorder and ADHD. Background info about my ex is below just in case it's helpful, and I do not have a preferred interpretation method. Thank you to everyone in advance.\n\n*Background on my ex: very short relationship a few years ago that didn't work out, but we eventually became best friends and have been very close for a little over 2 years now. She got back together with a guy she dated for years before me and they're married now. She and I still get physical sometimes (she says her husband is okay with it) and will even pretend to be girlfriends, so sometimes it feels like our relationship and feelings are deeper than \"just friends\".*\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nIn my dream, I was hanging out with my ex at her house and a few random girls we had met at the bar (not girls I know in real life, my brain just made them up). I remember feeling left out and not included for most of the time. She was flirting with these girls and playing with their hair, letting them lay on her, etc. (all stuff that she typically does with me in real life). At one point, my ex asked me to go outside and get something for her (I don't remember what it was), but I went outside and it was dark because it was nighttime. I was looking for the thing she wanted me to get and I came across this snake. It was huge, mostly light green with some large black diamond shapes on it and [looked like this](https://br.pinterest.com/pin/682295412270638671/). Not sure what it actually was, but I knew for a fact it wasn't a local species where I live (Midwest U.S.) I didn't see it at first and startled it, so it hissed at me and started standing up. I backed away and told the snake, \"I'm really sorry, I didn't see you there\" and then it left me alone.\n\nThen, one of my ex's neighbors came over to me and asked me if I wanted him to kill the snake for me. Again, this isn't someone I know, my brain just made him up. I told him no and it was fine, the snake wasn't bothering me anymore and I had just startled it. I kept looking for whatever it was I supposed to be getting, and I found a second snake. This one was a lot smaller, with a brownish-red banding pattern. I'm not sure if it was a local species, but it definitely looked a lot less exotic, [sort of like this](https://www.flickr.com/photos/73683441@N07/16795702747). This time I didn't startle the snake, so we made eye contact but left each other alone and I moved on to keep looking.\n\nAfter that, this big animal that resembled a panda bear came up to me and started nibbling on my hand and grabbed onto me. It was really friendly, but it was very clingy and latched on to me with its arms and would not let go. I remember thinking that it must have been a baby that had lost its mom. I was trying to look it up on my phone to found out what type of animal it was. While I was doing that, my ex came outside to see what was taking me so long and to make sure I was okay. I told her everything that had happened and when I got done explaining, I noticed that the panda-like animal was gone. I also tried to show her the snakes, but I found them both dead on the ground tied up against a spear. The neighbor said he killed them because they were dangerous, but then I got very upset and told him that they weren't bothering anyone, this was their home too, and they didn't deserve to die. After that, my ex and I spent the rest of the dream trying to find the panda-like animal because I wanted to save it."

I was walking along some kind of water, not sure if it was a lake, or river. I remember seeing a lot of snakes. Then we (my boyfriend and I) came upon my dog and a either a crocodile or alligator. They had my dogs leg in their mouth when I approached it it released my dog and my boyfriend tried to come behind it and grab my dog out of harms way but it turned around and grabbed my dogs leg again. It had to be shot a few time before it released my dog. We scooped up my dog and tried to rinse blood from him so I could see how bad his injuries were. Both his front legs had about half of his fur gone. Then I noticed the bite may have gotten an artery in his arm because the blood wouldn‚Äôt stop.

Now, this doesn‚Äôt seem too weird, but I haven‚Äôt seen them in ages yet their house was fully detailed in the dream. Another thing I noticed was that everything seemed to be 90‚Äôs themed. The cars, houses, decorations, the whole vibe of the dream. \n\nI was waiting in front off their garden when I (in the dream) remembers someone telling me to not take the medicine. I‚Äôm confused as I stand there when a car pulls up beside me. The people inside are having fun and laughing as the driver offers me a packet of prescribed medication. I decline but they continue to insist until the car I‚Äôm waiting for arrives. The others drive off. \n\nThe person?, that earlier told me not to take the medicine tells me that my ‚Äústep cousin‚Äù is taking the medicine. I get into the car that is supposed to take me to my soccer game. (I haven‚Äôt played soccer for over two years now.) Anyway we make small talk in the car when the stranger that sit beside me offers me another package of the same prescribed medication. I tell her off but she continues to insist and tells me that it‚Äôs much better and healthier to take. That it will make me feel much better. A warning flag goes off in my head and I ignore her for the rest off the ride. The driver which is someone I know (not in real life, idk who that was) then proceeds to take a wrong turn and drives to a nearby health centre.\n\nI‚Äôm confused but follows the others inside. In the centre everyone is working and the driver guide me to an office while she talks about how good and necessary the medication is. She then tells me that she‚Äôs almost finished with making the medication legal. She then offers me some of the pills. I ask to read the labels but she just laugh at my question. She then tells me to either take the pills or I will get the medicine injected. I start panicking and ask her about the soccer game. She tells me that we will go there when I take the medication. \n\nI try to look for an exit but she just laughs and yet again tells me to take the medication. She then leans down to my ear and tells me that the pills are much, much better than the injections. And that only fools take the injections. She then hands me the packet of pills.

    "body": "I am one to believe dreams have meanings but usually don‚Äôt often have nightmares or dreams that are disconcerting enough to care to find out what they mean. However I had a series of nightmares last night which weren‚Äôt entirely all that bad I think just due to a lack of vividness, though they were VERY out of the my dreaming norm and played out as a series of dreams all with the same unnerving theme.\n\nThroughout these dreams I found myself running from a sort of sinister evil or evil spirit that was hunting people down and killing them. The first dream involves me working at some unfamiliar store where people began to die spontaneously on shift but we were expected to stay. Remaining staff and I realized the cause was staring into the reflection of an old TV in the store because when doing so, intense fear and the feeling of an evil presence would wash over you. I don‚Äôt know why but I kept wanting to look into it to figure out exactly what it was and a feeling of impending doom grew each time until I finally sprinted out of the store and ran to my car and sped out of the parking lot like my life depended on it, feeling like if I wasn‚Äôt out of there fast enough, I was next.\n\nSimilar scenarios repeated in smaller dreams I had later on in the night where I kept finding myself wanting to investigate these very malevolent energies coming from reflections.  I think I wanted to investigate both out of curiosity and a hope that it would go away. One small dream involved me looking into the reflection of the sliding glass door in my kitchen and would feel waves of fear wash over me but nothing happened. Another dream didn‚Äôt involve a reflection I recall but involved me being in my house with a coworker of mine and sprinting outside to my car while desperately pleading with this coworker to come outside and get in the car with me all while they were confused and asking my why. One last related one involved my walking down the street past the store from the first dream to see if the evil energy was still there and killing the workers.\n\nFinally, this last one was a little different and didn‚Äôt feel scary to me in the moment but was very creepy and sinister in nature. I was in this very old dingy apartment that was very colorless and filled with dusty sunlight. There were a bunch of friendly but timid monsters living together on this floor I was on. They were all just lifelessly doing nothing while I was desperately searching all the rooms for something. They did not bother me until I opened a door that led to an attic above. As soon as I did all the monsters started fearfully and angrily screaming and yelling NOOO!!! NOO!!! And suddenly blood starts pouring down the stairs and I feel fear wash over me and I sprint outside and begin running from the apartment building. I look back and from a dormer window on the roof I see two creatures watching me, one large and one small- one white with large black voids for eyes and one black with large white voids for eyes. I run as fast as I can but they continue to watch me until finally from a third person perspective I watch my eyes melt out of my head and my body collapse to its knees. It felt like I turned into one of the monsters living in that place.\n\nI don't usually have dreams like this, let alone a series of them all night. I'm mostly unbothered about it but am also very curious what it all could mean if it does mean something. I'm at a relatively good place in life right now and have been doing good inner work so it's not something I would expect to be within me with this sudden intensity at this moment in time. What are your thoughts?"

This is then the dream ends. I've had this same dream for many years when I was child. The intersection looked very beautiful and way too modern for that time.\n\nWhen I turned 18 or so (around year 2015) , I needed to go to a different city for some works with my dad. This is the city which is approximately 60 kms away and I had never been there. So I was driving the car and my dad was sitting on the passenger sit. The road network was in rectangular pattern and after crossing a few intersections, I was right at the same spot I used to get dreams of. It immediately clicked me that I'm on the same lane, and there is this bus coming on the opposite lane and that there is a median in between to separate the opposite traffic. Except that my mom and sister weren't there and they weren't taking the bus, it was me and my dad only there. \n\nBut everything I saw in those dreams happened right back at that time and at that intersection.

I was calculating whether there‚Äôs a chance I/we would survive if it happened.\n\nAnd then suddenly I was with another set of friends at a different location. We were waiting for a concert to start? Whilst waiting, I got into a verbal argument with someone bc I was defending my friend they were arguing with. I said stuff that weren‚Äôt nice (incl. calling them ugly). After a bit, I apologised to them, saying I was really filled with so much emotions + I had a bit of alcohol to drink. I think they forgave me but it was so weird bc they rang everyone‚Äôs phone (the 2000s kinda phones), and they were talking about me. But they were actually saying nice things about me. I felt a bit guilty but also relieved.\n\nFast forward to driving back to the place me and my high school friends were staying at. I was at the back seat and someone else was driving. It was a really clear night but the road was wet (like it just rained) and the moonlight was really bright, reflecting on the wet road. The road was really wide and going straight only. I was a bit worried bc there were a lot of big potholes, some looked like they were really massive deep holes but the car just drove past the holes, barely affected by them. The driver didn‚Äôt bother avoiding them bc it was chill. So I ended up calming down bc everyone else wasn‚Äôt worried."

A woman I work with is my age. We talk at work and I enjoy our conversations when they are more serious about world topics or self topics. \n\nOnto the dream, I honestly don‚Äôt remember it too well, as usual. Main details are the sky is blue and we were in a large group of people, mainly co workers and random faces, at some open station where a bus or train was about to leave, but the girl and I were going separate ways (In reality, yesterday was her last day of work before she goes on a three month long trip). I was lined up to board the vehicle, but something told me she left a note for me on the opposite side of the fence I was on. So I‚Äôm hecticly running to get it. Open it and go back to my spot in line, and it has quite a bit written on it but I couldn‚Äôt really read it, I just got the interpretation that she asked me on a date. In the dream when I got glances of her she wore a red jacket, which she wears in reality too. \n\nIn reality, I feel like we have a superficial zing. Kind of like the feeling of infatuation I‚Äôve had in past relationships that I know will eventually expire. But I also enjoy her qualities as friendly company at work. \n\nI am questioning this because I love my relationship with my partner and don‚Äôt think I would have a more fulfilling relationship with this co worker.

I believe my siblings were with me there also. \n\nWe looked out the back door to see a giant brown bear closing in on our home. My brother said if we leave it alone it will not attack. \n\nAs the oldest, I wanted to be sure the bear did not hurt us. I pulled out a shot gun &amp; began firing. The bear was stealthy &amp; dodged every bullet until the weapon jammed. (Im not much of a shooter anyway) \n\nThis clearly pissed off the bear. My siblings &amp; I retreated inside. Later the bear busted down the back door. This door happened to lead down to our basement, as well as into the rest of the home. My brother was now trapped in the basement as the bear made its way towards me. \n\nI slammed another door in way face of the bear, for that door to also be knocked down. I grabbed the gun to try shooting again, only to be left hitting the bear upside the head with it. This stopped the bear for a minute. \n\nAfter I briefly delayed the attack by hitting the animal, it began coming towards me again. It stepped on top of one of the doors it busted down. As it did I reached down towards that door, lifted it up with the bear on it &amp; threw both the door &amp; the animal away from me. \n\nIt was at this moment the bear seemed to realize I was not going to give up this fight. We stood staring at each other in the house until I woke up sweating. \n\nI have my ideas on what this means. I‚Äôm interested in the thoughts of my fellow dream lovers too! Cheers!"

I suspected a male staff member had something to do with it but I wasn‚Äôt sure which one so I blamed one guy at a time. Every guy I blamed was fired. I was surprised. I didn‚Äôt realize my words had so much power. Then I found the perpetrator. I caught him on camera. I told the principal. She asked why I felt like I needed proof this time and I said because I plan to press charges.\n\nScene cut I‚Äôm in a break room of some kind. I notice that one of the male staff members that I got fired was there. He was someone I liked a lot and I did not mean to get him fired. I wanted him to notice me so I tried to look cute. \n\nHe ended up noticing me and came over. He said you‚Äôre really toxic you know that. You caused a lot of people to loose their jobs all because of your intuition. You come off so strong and crazy. And you know what I really freaking love that. I was trying so hard not to look at you but you are so cute I couldn‚Äôt help but come over here. \n\nIn my dream I was so happy that he still liked me and did not take my actions personally. Although they were extreme. \n\nThen before I woke up the scene cut again to me being an intern at a news station. They were trying to teach me how to be a news reporting journalist. My dreams often cut to me being an intern at a news station. I‚Äôm not sure why. At this point though my past dream felt like a memory.\n\nAt the news station I was doing my job. I was walking around helping to write news stories as well as weather scripts. Then I was approached by the head anchor. He stopped me and put his hand on my upper arm and said ‚Äú(My Name), I have been seeing you around here lately and I think you‚Äôre really great. Would you like to go get a cup of coffee after work?‚Äù I responded yes and said as long as it‚Äôs appropriate I don‚Äôt mind. He said it was appropriate and went to his chair to start his news cast. \n\nI‚Äôve had this dream multiple times and he would always pay close attention to me. I‚Äôd catch him watching me work sometimes. I figured that was the dream warning me to watch out for people watching me. Until I had this new dream last night. \nA little about the News Anchor; he was older than me, a different race, and he had a face you‚Äôd remember. His face was not always kind, which is why I assumed my other dreams were warnings. But when he touched me I felt like he had good loving intentions and couldn‚Äôt help but smile. \n\nMostly however when I dreamed of being a news station intern I payed very little attention to him and just enjoyed my dream. It was fun being an intern. \n\nOh and one other thing this news station set was very obviously in another realm sort of. It was cloudy looking, shaky and the outside looked like stars in space. Usually my dreams are clear like a memory I am certain of in HD."

I haven‚Äôt thought of her in months and I would like to say I‚Äôm pretty much over her as the relationship ended in her telling me she fell out of love with me. I was hurt at the time but moved on because I had more important things to focus on . I definitely let the breakup run its course though and worked it all out in my head and heart, as it did hurt. But like I said I haven‚Äôt though about her in months and really have no emotions connected to her anymore nor have I been in contact with her since the whole breakup. But anyways I had a really stressful and long day at work and got home early so I took a little nap. During that nap I had a dream where I ended back up at her place and in her room. The dream had a very weird atmosphere and not a good feeling to it. The vibe was definitely off. We were kind of on the opposite sides of the room but still having conversation. I don‚Äôt remember everything in full detail but I do remember her telling me how it was nice seeing me again and it almost felt like she was trying to reconnect with me. She was also saying how it was nice to be around each other again , she complemented me on my looks and was saying how I looked good. We ended up talking a bit more from what I remember but don‚Äôt remember about what exactly. But then before the dream ended‚Ä¶ I started choking , it felt like my whole throat was full of phlegm that I could not get out . After coughing and gagging trying to clear my throat I woke up. I had a really weird feeling upon waking up and everything just didn‚Äôt feel right the rest of the day. Is there any hidden message that just like flew right over my head? Or anything I should take note of? Anything helps, this was such a weird dream and experience and have never had a dream anything like this at all. Even after the breakup I never had a dream like this. Any further questions I‚Äôd be happy to answer but I‚Äôm genuinely confused as to what the dream means.

Also, I take 2 types of sleeping medication so it might not even be a dream it could just be chemicals; but anyway,\n\nIt started around 2 years ago after a very stressful event. It began almost like an out of body experience, where I knew I was asleep, I always know I'm asleep, but it felt like I was drifting upwards and could see my body from above. Kinda fun but I also didn't wanna float away too far incase I never came back, it was as if i knew I couldn't float too far away because something not so nice would happen, but still kinda funky. \n\nI'm not sure when, but then they started to get darker. I'd 'wake up', open my eyes and see something in my room, and I started to feel like I was no longer floating up- but going down. I lived alone and ended up moving house where I live with other people. I thought that would make it go away but it hasn't.\n\nNow I'm not scared of it, but its more of an annoyance. I go to sleep, I wake up and I just start dream-punching whatever shadowy figure is beside me until I wake up. The imagined presence doesn't feel like some sort of evil entity, but it's also not very comforting? And it also doesn't feel like the same 'presence' each time. I just don't feel like watching me sleep is a very cool thing to do so like, get out of my house. Last night, it felt as if I was slowly being sucked off my bed and vacuumed downwards. I can always wake myself up by shadowboxing air. Maybe it's sleep paralysis, but why it happens every night I'm not sure. I have a certain trick to get rid of it, and if I do that before bed I never get those dreams- but I'm not always in the mood every single night if you get me\n\nAlso, the dreams never happen if there's someone else physically in my room, like if I'm babysitting a cat or get lucky enough to bring someone home one night.\n\nBut who the hell am I fighting in my sleep?"

I then fall off the bed and get some sort of head injury. I begin screaming for my mom, but she walks away to get someone else. I then starting puking this clear liquid, that was causing me issues to breath. She comes back and say \"just breathe\" then she gets on the phone to call my grandma and uncle to give us a ride to the hospital. Well they started arguing, then my mom gets mad and says forget it she's not going to help. I then remember trying to stumble out of the room- but I was unable to see properly. Like my vision was of me in some sort of dark hallway with multiple doors and stairs. I was still calling out to my mom with no help or answer. Somehow I make it outside and cops appear, and so does my mom . At this time, she appears concerned talking about \"someone help her , my baby\" It changed to me in the hospital, in a surgery room. I was awake, and the doctor put some sort of iv into my side/abdominal area. I remember that my brain had a infection, and they was trying to pump antibiotics directly into my stomach. \nThen very vividly-like this felt so real. I started puking, and choking on my own blood. I remember in the dream I felt very fearful but I was trying to stay calm and breath. Like, I felt my \"light\" fading out. I really felt death creep up, slowly. I had enough time to acknowledge the fact that I was dying, and to be scared. Briefly I tried to fight it, then I accepted-even said a small prayer to God something like \"Forgive me father, and if this is my time I accept this. Take me\" once that was said I \"fell unconscious\" in my dream and saw some sort of light. A beautiful welcoming light, i felt a sense of peace, love and longing. Like I really wanted to go, fully ready to set life aside and move on to the light. Once my \"soul\" begin leaving from my body, the dream ended and I woke up. I was very confused, and sad that I was not able to reach the light. Like my first thought was \"I wanted to go\" \n\nI'm not really sure the meaning or message of this dream,but I cannot emphasize enough on how real everything felt. When I was choking I really felt like I was losing my breath. When I was \"dying\" - I really believe I felt the presence of Death itself. Seriously, I woke up sad that I didn't die for real? How strange is that?\n\nAnyway, thank you for taking your time reading this. If you have any insights, or interpretations please leave a comment. I'd love to see how other people see the meaning behind this, or have experienced something similar."

I am not exactly terrified but I am scared and sad and pushing down feelings. \n\nI search everywhere I keep thinking that a new car will cost all my savings but at least I have those savings. I call my brother and he asks me to check with the locals there, no one has seen the car and the locals are a rowdy, muddy bunch. I see a car exactly like mine but the number plate is different and the dickey of the car is open with different number plates in it. I think I approach a police man as well but dont get a conclusive answer. \n\nI don't know when the following happens but the land starts to shake a divide like a wall sets up and lift me high up , on my left, over the muddy crowdy people who have now all come together below me and I can see their heads from say the height of a 12 storey building and on my right is just swirling mud and I am on a divider of mud between the muddy people and actual mud on the right. I then wake up. \n\nI have had several dreams earlier that have had slushy mud, crowds and night in them. Any thoughts?"

    "body": "In this dream, my family had a farming and ice fishing business. I was left responsible for the ice fishing. At some point I go up to the ice, take out my large knife and plunge it straight into the ice, causing a North Star shaped hold to appear who's four points extend out for miles, basically cutting the lake into four sections with a brilliant North Star at the center. I immediately sense great danger is coming. I know that a legendary great white shark, one that's been threatening yet eluding my family for generations, is about to come out of the center of the hole. I call out to my family for help, but they're too distracted on their phones to notice or care. I'm terrified, realizing I'm  gonna have to face the shark alone and hold it off by myself until I can knock some sense into my family. The shark is now taunting me, it knows I'm alone and afraid and is basically just toying with me now, throwing insults, knocking me up and down. I manage to stab it a few times, and it manages to sink its teeth into my leg. I run away, but it makes its way onto land and I'm now playing hide and seek with it hoping it doesn't find me. I muster some bravery, and I succeed in confronting the shark and cutting it up into pieces, half its body still submerged in the waters right where the hole is. I keep telling my family, \"look! Look! The great white shark we've been trying to kill for generations is *right there!* why won't you help?\" They finally listen and come to the hole, but at this point the shark has already run off, though I get the sense it's only been temporarily defeated. I then lecture my family about not being distracted on their phones and taking me seriously when I cry for help, because though I successfully fended off this one, more sharks are soon to come."

This went on for yearssss in the dream which is bizarre in itself. Well towards the very end of the dream these two non-identical twin girls wearing blue and red striped shirts (probably 8-9 years old\" appeared and told us that God was calling us to come home. it was exteamlyyy realistic, I remember feeling the emotions so strongly  I am not super religious irl, I do believe in a higher power but have always been iffy on heaven/hell. Anyways, when the twins told us that we cried tears of joy bc we were finally going to be free and see all of our loved ones who passed before us etc. We entered this hole/portal and everything went white and it smelled like a doctor's/dentist office. I remember my actual consciousness thought all of this was 100% real and I was wondering how i died irl. I then landed in my bed and woke up and was in such shock I thought I was really dead and just didn't make it heaven like I thought I was. I thought real life was actually fake/back in purgatory or something so I woke up my partner to make sure i was actually alive.

There was more to the dream than what I am about to write, but I can only vividly remember the part that I want help with interpreting. \n\nThe part of the dream that I only have a broad rememberance of has to do with me going about my daily life which were things such as shopping, visits to relatives (or what felt like relatives) and such. Then all of a sudden, I am assuming, nearing the end of my sleep, I was in an explosion (or blown up). With my body still in tact,  I was hurled into the sky spiraling closer and closer to outer space without protective equipment of any sort on so I had no oxygen to assist me with breathing. As I am moving further into space, I start feeling pressure build up in my body. I then started gasping for air. Everything around me starts to get dark as I inch closer and into space. I feel like the explosion and being sent into space happened at least twice in a row. Then, I woke up."

We played together for a little while with it?him?her? on my left arm and her claws were really cutting up my arm. I was bleeding a lot, my whole arm was drenched in blood.

For example:\n\n\\- The first week after i ended things, I dreamt about wanting to reach out to him on whatsapp, or either me looking at his contact details while debating on contacting him again. I felt like i really missed him (i do irl but i didn't want to because i know its not good for me at the moment), but at the end I didn't contact him in my dreams. I dreamt about this multiple times.\n\n\\- Then it progressed to me visiting his hometown (we live in different states), I went to his close friend's cafe and then we met by chance there. He didn't seem like he wanted to talk to me but he stuck around and didn't leave the cafe until my dream finished. Same thing, just me visiting him or him visiting me but we don't talk at all.\n\n\\- Or sometimes even just me dreaming of looking at him, no words spoken but just looking at him.\n\n\\- And last night, i dreamt about playing a game together with him (we are both gamers) and we were talking again but for some reason he was streaming his gameplay on twitch while playing with me? The vibe was okay and he was like before things started going downhill for us.\n\nAny ideas what these dreams mean?

    "body": "I once had a (non lucid) dream which started with me flying a biplane, by myself, from the hangar near my home. I did half of a barrel roll then slipped out of the plane and plummeted to the ground far below, but I did not hit the ground. I suddenly found myself in a small white room with a kids table and chairs, there were some cubbies on the wall and a tall dark entity in the corner. This was many years ago and I don't remember much else.\n\n\nMore recently, only a year or two ago, when I was really into lucid dreaming I dreamt that I woke up from a foreign bed in a stained-wood room. When I was able to detach from my physical body and move freely in the dream I left the room and found a stone hallway that lead to an open area. Directly in front of thw hallway was a large opening that revealed I was in a carved-out cave. To the left there was what felt like a kitchen. To the right there was an open area that was not lit by thw outside light and was very dark. It was epecially dark behind a stone pillar where I felt a presence. The presence stepped into the light and was my grandmother, this is when I fully realized I was in a dream, and the excitement woke me up. Eager to continue the expeince I went back to sleep, but I did not find myself inside the cave with my grandma. This time I was fully lucid inside an office building. I explored a bit and found an opening that met with a yellow lake. There were mountains off to the right. Above to the left there was a bridge-like structure so I spider-man swung up to it. I dipped into the waters and saw that from below/within it was a mucky brown-yellow, unlike the lovely golden surface. I felt like a see monster was gonna get me so I got above the bridge as quick as possible. The waters washed away the control I normally have in a lucid dream but I still remained quite conscious as I landed on the structure and found a large metal clearing with a small black pyramid a hundered or so meters away that had golden markings in a language I do not know. I found myself directly in front of the pyramid and felt the presence of a tall entity behind me (I don't remember seeing them but in my mind they ooked like Anubis). This being wordlessly communicated to me that their world was in danger and the moon was needed to save them, then the clouds dissipated enough for a giant moon to shine it's brilliance on the pyramid and it's golden writings started glowing blue. Then the glowing stopped as the moon was again covered by clouds. Had I remembered that I was dreaming I would've moved the clouds myself (I've done so before, pulling clouds together and darkening them to conjure lightning, I assume I could pull them apart too) so the best thing I could think to do was call on the Greek goddess of the moon, Artemis. When I shouted her name I felt what I could only describe as a ripple across realms. Then I was ripped from that world and into a grey-white limbo where I felt like I was falling in multiple directions while myriad voices were talking angrily but I couldn't hear them, not until one said \"you are the worst of us\" then I woke myself up bc that sh*t was terrifying...\n\nI'd love to hear some interpretations of what these dreams may have meant!"

They're flirting or interacting bizarrely.  One is lying down and the other is touching her face with her foot (toes).

  {
    "body": "Key word \"loosely\".  It's on the general design of player characters and their general culture that carried over into the dreams.  Everything else was different\n\nThe game these dreams were drawing from is this one.  [Sky: Children of the Light](https://youtu.be/aBQRCHusYyU)\n\nThere were a lot of differences in the dream though.  For example, in the game, while you can swim under water as a secondary mechanic, it's jenky and you have a limited oxygen supply and the main emphasis in the game is on the flying mechanics instead.\n\nIn my dream, it was the opposite.  Yes, I was my in game character, but it was a world where the sky people were largely amphibious.  Even though we could go above land or even fly if they wanted to, we needed to be underwater to truly flourish\n\nI first caught a glimpse of this world in another dream a few nights ago.  I was living in an underwater city with a gamified version of my family.  But I came up to the surface one morning and noticed off in the distance, miles away, what looked to be a beautiful stone mansion on a hillside at the top of a ravine that we were in the middle of\n\nI asked my dad about it and he told me to stay away from that place.  He said that those were invaders who had drained most of the water in the valley which had once been a large river and the we were left with only a fraction of our original territory as a result.\n\nHe warned me never to go near them.  Said they were hostile and hated us.  He said they were scared of us because of our mobility as the only known race who could swim, fly, and run with ease.  They thought we could ambush them at any time and they wouldn't be able to defend themselves\n\nI thought that was ridiculous because we were a pretty peaceful race (look at the game Sky for reference.  It was practically the same thing).  So when nobody was looking I decided I wanted to go talk to them, and took off on the long flight across the ravine\n\nAnd that's where the first dream ended.\n\nOh, and did I mention the \"invaders\" were humans?  That seems pretty important\n\nSo last night's dream seemed to pick up where the first one left off.  Actually, I think I might have even skipped over some stuff because it started inside the mansion with no context for how I got there or how the people living there initially reacted when I showed up\n\nAll I knew was that I shouldn't be there and was desperate to get out\n\nAnd while there were people in the mansion, all dressed in formal wear and drinking martinis, they weren't actively screaming or throwing things at me or anything extreme.  Instead, they all just gave me \"the look\".  You know the one.  That hateful death glare you'd shoot at someone when you're barely tolerating their presence and want them to just leave ; a barely contained rage seething just beneath the surface, threatening to boil over\n\nEventually, I got to what must have been the mansion's front entrance because I saw something that took my breath away\n\nI saw a large dam miles tall and even further in with, and beyond it, an endless expanse of ocean.  I could have just dived into all that water and never looked back; freer than I'd ever been\n\nBut I couldn't\n\nMy family was in the opposite direction.  And if I went out that way, I'd likely never see them again\n\nSo, reluctantly, I had to turn back.  I had to go back through the mansion\n\nLuckily, it had one of those main foyer type of setups where the front and rear exits are essentially connected by a long hallway with rooms branching off.  So it didn't take long to find the exit\n\nI ran out onto the patio dived straight into some water, thinking in the moment that I was home free.  I gulped in lungfuls of water with the same eagerness that you might when coming up for air after swimming.  It was a beautiful place with lots of colorful coral and sunlight refracting onto the bottom\n\nBut that moment was short lived\n\nTurns out it was only a retention pond.  And as I begrudgingly crawled up the rocky shore on the other side, I found, to my dismay, a large brick wall, at least two stories tall, separating the mansion from what lay beyond it.\n\nI would have just flown to the top, but I was too wore out.  My wings didn't work.  So I had to climb up.\n\nIt took ages and it hurt a lot.  But eventually, I made it to the top.  And on the other side, I found that same ravine from the first dream.\n\nThe small lake my family lived in was miles away; nothing but a pitiful creek at the bottom on the way there.  And I couldn't fly anymore.  So I knew I had a long, difficult journey ahead of me\n\nThen I woke up\n\nDISCLAIMER: If this came off as long winded or disjointed.  I'm sorry.  I just woke up and I needed to get this out of my head while it was still fresh\n\nEDIT: Also, I don't know if it matters, but [this is what my game character looks like](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/902562752734842961/1108404748551462973/SKY_20230506_185844_.jpg) and it's more or less how I looked in the dream too"

Before I walked in I turned back to the ladies and asked if they could help me. One of them said \"but you've already begun\". That's when I realized the image of what I could see in the doorway was burned into my eyes. And it only went back to normal if I was looking into that room. So I walked in and my vision was normal again.\n\nThe room was a large horizonal cylinder with computer monitors on each end and along the sides. \n\nThe room also glowed with blue lights. It looked like a mash up of futuristic and spiritual. \n\nThere was something I had to find to get out of the room. Somehow I instinctively knew I had to pick up one of the monitors and move it around. All the information on the screen changed when I moved it. It was identical to one of those 360 pictures where you move your phone to see all around you.\n\nEventually I matched up the monitor with whatever it was I needed to. \n\nThen I went out of the room and I was at a staircase. I had to race someone up the stairs. They were wooden stairs.\n\nI began to run up the stairs and there was a trail of candy all the way up the stairs. I couldn't help but eat the candy as I was running up them. \n\nI finally reached the top and asked the other person why they went a different way but they didn't answer. \n\nI woke up shortly after."

These same people held me captive in a different nightmare so as soon as I saw them I knew they were going to try to kill me. I saw the woman outside my house first. Ran around locking doors and windows when I realized a window was busted and they were already in my house. So I ran to my closet. I remember panicking when I got to my closet thinking ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way for me to escape from here, why would I hide somewhere with no exits?‚Äù So I tried calling the police. They had cut my Wi-Fi somehow so I had to turn my Wi-Fi off and call again (doesn‚Äôt make sense I know lol) and as I‚Äôm otp with dispatch, too huge, bald, angry men with large machetes open my closet door. I knew it was over. There was no escape. No convincing them not to kill me. No fighting them off. I grabbed my boyfriend who was in the closet with me, hid my face in him so I didn‚Äôt see what they were about to do to me, and told him ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù (we don‚Äôt say that to each other yet irl) then I woke up screaming."

    "body": "I (22f) have had at least 1 to 2 dreams every year where the same person (22m) shows up, usually in the role of a love interest. The dreams range from pleasant to scary to anxiety producing. I don‚Äôt remember them really but he would usually support me or help me fix the in-dream problem.\n\nI first met this guy was the summer before 6th grade at a camp we went to. I definitely thought he was cute, and was absolutely floored when I passed by him in the school hallway a couple months later. Throughout middle school I developed a crush that I would like to think was similar to crushing on your favorite celebrity in the sense that I knew there was no way in hell I stood a chance, but I couldn‚Äôt stop admiring him for his personality, smarts, and looks. I was always nervous to not appear stupid if he was around and was actively trying to be quieter when I‚Äôm usually pretty up-beat. \n\nIn high school there were a few classes we had together, and I would always have the feeling he would be glancing at me. I‚Äôd catch him looking away (because of course I would be glancing at him every now and then) and I even did the yawn test just to make sure I wasn‚Äôt overthinking it. He yawned. Despite all of this, we had different friend groups, never spoke to each other unless we had to, and I still dated other people. I don‚Äôt believe he ever dated anyone until college. Both of our families go to the same synagogue and my dad and his dad are friends. \n\nI can‚Äôt remember when the dreams started but they were a lot more frequent than they are now. At first I just thought it was a one-off but it‚Äôs been 4 years since I‚Äôve seen him in person and I‚Äôm in a different state because of school. He is also currently in a relationship but I‚Äôve been so busy focusing on myself that I haven‚Äôt given him the time of day. I keep telling myself that I‚Äôm just overthinking everything, but the fact that he specifically has been more reoccurring than people who have hurt me or even those I cherish just doesn‚Äôt sit right with me. Does his reappearance in my dreams actually mean anything? Am I suppressing feelings? Or am I just overthinking it?"

    "body": "So in this dream I was staying at a barn during a party for some reason with some friends of mine, they were smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol while I just sat in some hay looking at the fenced landscape. After some time, I go inside the barn and I find lots of people who were drinking, doing drugs and partying whilst lights shined around and music played in the background, but that's not what surprised me the most, because there was a pale young lion sitting near 2 wooden poles looking back at me, it didn't seem like it wanted to harm me so I get a bit closer so that I can see it in case it decides to pounce at me while I'm distracted or something.\n\nSome time goes by and people start putting on louder music and start jumping around, this makes the lion uncomfortable, resulting in him standing up and walking away from his spot, but whilst he strides forward, his paw meets with a woman's foot and his claws sink into it, causing her to scream in pain. This makes everyone briefly stop and then start screaming and running around, while makes the lion when more scared, resulting in him biting the people who come close to him defensively. \n\nI don't know what's the meaning of this dream but I'm sure it has something to do with responsibility. I don't wanna sound like one of those annoying people that bug people who smoke or drink but the people at the party were clearly indulging recklessly, something not very responsible, and the lion also was not restrained in any way, he wasn't in a cage or with a leash tying him to those poles, he was completely free and able to do whatever he so desired to do. I think that the lion represent the responsibility (or lack thereof), once the people began to do all kinds of irresponsible things, the lion grew more and more agitated, and when the breaking point happened, he completely lashed out at everyone. \n\nWhat do you guys think this could possibly mean?"

Also, I realize lions mane causes nightmares I won‚Äôt be taking it at night anymore, but still, I‚Äôve recently read nightmares are the brains way to cope with trauma. So, with that being said I was ok with it happening eventually. \n\nFirst the dream started off as a NSFW dream w/ my girlfriend, there is definitely lead up to the second part, but I don‚Äôt recall, (I absolutely know there was more in between, but absolutely nothing is recalled, up until the nightmare, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve experienced that before).\n\nNow, I was with my boys and girl, we called into a haunted house to go visit it, we set reservations. When we got there, nobody took are tickets at the door, it was just open and nobody there. We went in and we were giggling and thought it was funny and waiting for a jump scare, although, nothing was happening so we got confused and a little creeped out. It was a dark, cold and empty house. \n\nWe decided to go upstairs, I walked into the bathroom and before I even got in I saw a extremely tall, skinny, lengthy man who looked like he hadn‚Äôt eaten in years. All I remember seeing was his foot which was extremely bruised, but somehow I know exactly what he looked liked without even looking at his whole body. Weird I know.  \n\nHis face looked like the rake, but I didn‚Äôt see it visually I just knew, it‚Äôs confusing, but yeah. I slammed the door shut and freaked the f*** out I told everyone and we realized we probably should get the hell out and this wasn‚Äôt what we thought. We ran to the door and everything closed, everything. Windows locked, doors locked, everything immediately as we attempted to escape. \n\nWe then heard the man climbing around in the ceiling like an extremely loud spider. My buddy Jeff decided to get out on the outside patio which wasn‚Äôt unlocked, although somehow we all knew we weren‚Äôt allowed to leave, but he tried anyway. When outside the patio it was gated and he jumped off which was literally a small 3 foot drop maximum, and he immediately broke apart, legs amputated, arms still intact to his torso blood everywhere. \n\nWhat really bothered me was he was still alive and was attempting to scoop his organs and intestines back into his stomach and get his legs back. He was screaming and yelling help me! \n\nWe called the cops, (not when we were locked in a house with spider-demon-man, but when are friend fucking exploded into a million pieces, I know, I guess horror movies and dreams follow the same rule, being dumb). \n\nThey came and he was asking them for help cause he was still alive and they just threw him to the side where there was another mysterious dead body. Then I woke up with the worst derealization and anxiety, but yeah, anybody think there is any meaning? \n\nMy home life hasn‚Äôt been the best lately and I‚Äôve been going through a lot of stress, also sorry for the long ass wall of text, this just helped me to journal it, thanks for reading!"

I put clothes in it for some unknown reason, but I remember they were clean clothes and not dirty clothes. I beat myself up about it and my step-dad says it's okay. Its during the time my mom serves dinner, and there's only enough food left for me and none left for my step-dad. I tell him 'here you can have the rest'. He says thank you and I choose to go without. It's a warm feeling.\nWell, cut to a scene the next morning, I notice shoots of asparagus growing out of my back! Three of them, and they're all flowering like the same one I was growing. I started freaking out and asked my Unphased parents if I should remove them myself. My mom said No because they would leave big open wounds that would get infected. I said You're Right. I begged my mom to take me to the hospital so I can get them removed. She ended up taking me, and they suggested taking me to a Special Hospital as this was a Special Case that doesn't happen everyday.\nI go up the stairs and my mom guides me to walk to the door in front of me. I walk through, and she immediately closes the door behind me. I try to open it but it won't open, I try to bang on it to have someone open it from the other side, no luck. \nI was scared and panicky. Inside was a waiting room with alot of windows with sun and plenty of chairs. There were two guys about my age (I'm going to be 23 here in a few days) who were sitting together in the corner not saying anything. They just looked at me as I sat there and made me feel uncomfortable. They got up and sat closer to me. They looked mentally unstable. I got up and moved away from them, playing musical chairs. Then they got up and moved closer to me again. At this time I told them I didn't feel comfortable and I'd just like to sit alone please. They didn't answer and I got up and decided to walk around to see if they followed. They followed me and looked like they were going to hurt me. I walked fast and noticed  the back office where a bunch of women were working with medications and documents and computers, and went into their area saying these 2 were going to hurt me. They didn't seem to care, and one of the guys ended up tackling me down, cutting my airway to breathe. I kept trying to scream saying I can't breathe I can't breathe, I'm going to die, I'm dead. One of the ladies there nonchalantly helped him off me and told them not to do it again. I was questioning why they didn't take it more seriously. The guys left me alone but were close by. I walked within the back office to try to be safe if anything happened. The 2 guys ccame in again and I was walking away from them as they followed me . They kept following me and I asked the ladies if this was normal and why they weren't doing anything. I then find another patient in the back office like me who kind of signals he's been going through the same thing but it is what it is. They medicate him and he just has to deal with it. \nI confront the girls and ask why they don't help the issue. One of the boss ladies insinuates that the two guys' family owns the hospital and they are being paid to let them do whatever they want. I spoke out against it and said it wasn't right and how your letting them control how you do your job and knowingly hurting people instead of helping. \nIt was then one girl came up behind me and syringed my foot with some sort of tranquilizer thing and I faded out.\nI woke up there in the same spot again and went in and said the same thing. How they are knowingly hurting people under their control. As I said it the second time,  I can see 2 or 3 girls side with me. However the bosses didn't like that and they said they weren't going to listen to me anymore and basically to syringe me again. One of the girls who was siding with me got the syringe but gave me a look and was reluctant. I said I don't need this to get better, I just need these plants out of my back so I can go home.\nThen I woke up. \n\nIn real life, I've just taken up gardening for the first time and am obsessed with growing my plants. Also, I just had asparagus for dinner last night but I don't live at my parents house. I've actually been living with Mt fiance in our own apartment for the last 2 years. Also, I am taking prescription drugs right now for depression and anxiety, but I've always felt they were a dead end and weren't fixing a problem.

I've forgotten quite a bit. \n\nThe \"villain\" here is a boy maybe about 19 to early 20s, an absolute terror, and protected by his family but is obviously psychotic, misogynistic, and on a power trip. He is scary and unhinged. The type of person you just don't want any kind of attention from.\n\nI was in what seemed like a church annex or something (I'm no longer a Christian) with a bunch of people. It was a small town, I think. We're in a kitchen and he's playing around with something. Two kinds of flammable chemicals like gasoline and hairspray. There are people working in the background and kids playing. My kids are upstairs. I told him to stop playing around. He ignored me (he knows best, you know the type) then decides to bring out a lighter. I decide it's time to get my kids and get out of there. As I walk past, The aerosol he had sprayed catches fire igniting both myself and the gasoline on the floor. I am desperately trying to get out and do the whole stop drop and roll thing. People are screaming. I think I manage to get out of the building. \n\nFast forward some time. I'm still in that town. My kids are alive but two of them had suffered from hypoxia and had severe disabilities. I can't remember the rest, but essentially this dude had walked away unscathed and was still protected and doing the same type of things. \n\nThis is all I can recall. Any thoughts on interpretation? Other than my kids, no one in the dream is a person in my waking life."

I then gazed at the stars, it was a clear night sky and the stars appears to be moving faster than usual. All of a  sudden, someone close to me popped out of nowhere inside the room, i then proceed to tell them there will be meteor showers tonight and it did happen right after i said it.

So let me get straight to the point at the very end of my dream, I remember turning around for some reason and in front of me is my cousin, let's call him James, crouched.down next to a babies car seat with one of those sun hoods covering the baby, preventing me from coming near. When I got closer and crouched down next to them to take a closer look he looked me straight into my eyes and told me that the baby died, and I just let out this blood curdling scream out that I actually felt it in my throat, which caused me to wake up.

I had my dog with me. The house was exactly as I remember it when I was a kid. I was walking into the living room at near dark, there was a man walking up the long gravel road to the back door. He wasn't and still isn't familiar in anyway. I remember he knocked on the door then rang the doorbell while I hid. It felt instinctual that I hide. My dog was barking and I became worried that the man would think the house was empty, and open to being robbed. So, I went to the door and cracked it. I made up a lie, \"my dad and brother's are just upstairs, cleaning their guns.\" But he had this wide grin as I said goodbye and shut the door. I think he was looking for directions he said. It's  close to bed time now and I have a vivid memory of this fist punching straight through the glass window by the door. I tried to get away but I couldn't. I don't have a memory of dreaming of the assault, but I know he raped me in the dream.\nThen I woke up, screaming and crying in my own bed, running to my mom. I told her about the dream I had before I saw my step dad. I ran to him and began crying even harder... then I actually woke up."

Inside the flat was a short hallway into a large room (my living current living room but with couches from when I was a child) \n\nIn the dream I decided I was going to get some cocaine. I knew it was a bad idea as I was working the next day but I did anyway. Someone showed up to sell me it. He seemed like an undesirable ( a ned/chav). I put the coke out as 5 lines but only took 3 because I was working, then lay down on the couch which turned into my current bed. As I lag there I could hear / see the coke dealer outside with another, both are dressed in tracksuits and are faceless. I know they are planning to Rob me, and can see one pulling out a knife. They allude to me being alone and being an easy target. As I lie in my bed I'm aware but not afraid. \n\nThen a big black shadow presence appear over the top of me from behind.

    "body": "I should start off by saying I am experiencing cannabis withdrawals, which is known to trigger more vivid and surreal dreams. \n\nLast night I had a dream that I befriended a disabled race car driver. His disabilities were from birth rather than an accident, but were incredibly severe and horrific. His legs were twisted and bent behind his back, and he had a pair of dead eyes which protruded from the top of his head. He also had prosthetic eyes where his real eyes should have been. At first he seemed pleasant, and I believe I worked in the garage that maintained his race car. At some point in the dream, we were both attending a party. Somehow, my friend had morphed into an even more deformed female , and was arguing with another woman at the party. All of a sudden, the disfigured woman began horrifically murdering the other woman. Tearing her breasts off, just an absolutely horrific scene. I fled from the party, found myself at the bottom of a grassy hill where I found my real life wife. We saw the disabled person at the top of the hill. They were now even larger, even more disfigured and resembled more of a monster than a person, yet in my mind I knew it was the same person all along. Me and my wife make a run for it and the dream ends. \n\nI remembered the dream when I woke, but it didn‚Äôt disturb me too much. It was only later in the day thinking about the dream that it‚Äôs really starting to bother me.  \n\nAfter typing this out I have come up with my own interpretation: \n\nThe disabled person is my addiction to cannabis. He is disabled because my addiction limits me almost like a disability. As he becomes more deformed, it is my addiction spiraling out of control. The woman he murders at the party is an element of my healthy psyche, which has been harmed by my cannabis use. I flee from the killer just like I have decided to leave cannabis behind. The disabled person becomes increasingly horrific and harmful just like my cannabis use was once a minor issue has spiraled into a potential catastrophe for my personal life. I found and fled with my wife because she really did save me from my addiction.\n\nWhilst I realize many people can have a casual relationship with cannabis, I have been a daily user from a young age which has undoubtably become a harmful addiction."

    "body": "Recently I've had a couple weird end of the world dreams, that I saw pretty close to each other. Just the concept of what was happening in them was so bizarre that I wrote down they key points as soon as woke up so that I don't forget them. They messed with my brain pretty hard. This is the first one I saw a few weeks ago.\n\nIt starts with me standing near a house. It appears that according to the situation I am in the dream - this is a house I grew up in, even though it is completely untrue in reality. There is a woman with me, my age, that appears to be my sister (not really, I don't have a sister). It is dusk, the sun is disappearing behind the horizon and the sky is red. The house is located close to a highway that climbs a rather steep hill. Everywhere I look in the yard (it looks kinda overgrown and abandoned, like it hasn't been taken care of for a while) I recall some chunks of memories of being a kid and growing up, playing there (which are obviously not real, I grew up living in an apartment).\n\nI walk towards the hill together with the woman. She is telling me something that I don't remember any more. I remember getting a very strong feeling of nostalgia and at the same time a feeling of great sadness because this is the last time I am going to see this place and the person next to me. We reach the top of the hill and I look down on the road and the forest below me. I don't know what makes me feel this - I have never seen that place or that woman in my life. And the feeling is very strong. I can't say I experienced anything like that for any place or person in the real life.\n\nThen the setting suddenly changes - I am standing in a park in the middle of the day. There are people around me, who are panicking. And I suddenly remember that there is something terrifying that appeared in the sky recently. Apparently, there is a new moon in the sky now. It is called Solomon's Shadow (I don't know where the name came from, in the dream I just know that this is what the moon is called). And it is an organic! moon. Meaning it is basically a huge living organism (but not conscious, it is basically like a plant or a primitive organism, or something like that). Sometimes it emits a ray of black light (literally a black beam) that destroys anything it covers (buildings, people the ground itself). It does this at random so basically there is no safe place on the planet where it can't reach. Whether or not you die is a lottery, there is no point in hiding. And the consensus is that there is no way to get rid of it and that it is going to destroy the Earth eventually. \n\nI look up at the sky and see this new moon. It looks like a dark pink blob of organic matter. It is around the same size as the sun appears in the sky. As I look at it, it emits the black beam somewhere not far from me and I hear people screaming. Then some female voice near me is saying \"It is growing. Will you go inside?\".  As I look it makes me feel a weird feeling of... awe, I guess? After a few moments I suddenly get pulled directly towards the moon and sucked inside of it. The same female voice says \"New module is growing. Module 1 - the flower\". When I appear inside the moon it looks like a pinkish sphere with rapidly growing plants and flowers inside of it. There are huge flat platforms randomly appearing in midair, made up of winding greenery. The space inside of it is huge, absolutely immense. I get suspended in the air for a few moments and then start freefalling. At which point I wake up. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI have no idea what to make of it. It just felt weird. Such a strange mixture of emotions - feeling so sad and nostalgic like I never felt before about the place I am seeing for the first time, and the whole experience of the new moon."

I don't remember my dreams often but recently I've been remembering dreams that caused me a lot of distress. Ive been watching war documentaries/horror genre recently. I haven't felt scared or uncomfortable while watching this stuff, more like intrigued. But when I have dreams about this stuff it feels traumatic in the moment.\n\nDream #1\n\nLet me start off by saying when I had this dream, I was super sick and had a really high fever. I felt genuinely so awful I convinced myself I had to go to the hospital. But instead my mom slept in my room with me and helped me throughout the night. \n\nI really don't remember much of this dream, or if it was more of a hallucination. But I had convinced myself the Chinese Government was hunting me down and wanting to preform experimental heart surgeries on me. They had these six different mechanical contraptions they would place inside my heart. They would then see which one worked best. This meant six different surgeries, if I didn't die. I remember waking up sobbing to my mom in the middle of the night about how they were after me and trying to kill me. She would reassure me that I was okay and needed to go back to sleep. My head was throbbing though and my heart felt physically hurt, even though no damage was done. I was in and out of sleep for hours, either waking up in terror about how they were hunting me down, or waking up to throw up. \n\nGenuinely one of the worst nights I've ever had. \n\nDream #2\n\nThis one happened maybe two nights after the first one mentioned (Just last night.) This one was very similar, except I stayed asleep for the whole dream and didn't wake up sobbing and delusional.\n\nIn this one, I had to get my four wisdom teeth removed. (I have it planned I have to get mine actually removed within the next year or so.) In this dream, I was in a dimly lit office, I wasn't nervous for the procedure, except for maybe the pain afterwards. I was aware of how this was going to work, so I was confident in it. I was put on one of those metal surgery tables, they drugged me up, and I was out. They removed the four teeth just fine, and I felt nothing. However, near the end of the procedure the anesthesia wore off and I was awake again. For some reason for the procedure they had to slit my wrists and let me bleed out. I was aware of this since the beginning, but for some reason the doctor couldn't do it, which meant I had to preform this myself. I grabbed a knife on the tray next to my table, and created several deep slits all over my forearm. I remember this being excruciatingly painful, as this was supposed to be done by the surgeon while I was unconscious. I had to lower my forearm to let the blood drip down my arm, and let me tell you, there was a lot of it. After the surgery, I remember questioning if they had really taken my teeth out, which my mom reached into my mouth and pressed down where they had previously been. \"Feel that? that means they're gone!\" I also had several scars all along my forearm.\n\nThat's all I remember from this one.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOne thing to mention is there were no faces for any of the surgeons. I don't have any trauma from surgery or any medical procedures, although it does make me a little weary. Nothing too bad ever, just a little nervous. \n\nI'm really curious as to what you guys think these could mean."

I remember telling her that my heads were so in the clouds because of what I was going through with my case manager that won't let me enroll in this government funded program that I forgot my suitcase. Btw that is something I am actually fighting in real life. \n\nI remember taking an Uber to school with this guy that was cute. We had sexual tension. I remember he was a guy that I was talking to on a reddit (idk him in real life). Idk why we went into a school bus but we were kissing there alone.\n\nHis gf came into the bus with her friends and I had no idea that he was taken. She didn't catch us kissing but I pretended be asleep.\n\nAfter us going our separate ways I was worried about not finding a place to live. I tried calling everyone I knew including my former housemate but no one was picking up.  I was able to stay at a dorm for the night but I remember being so stressed because I had no where to live but eventually my former housemate came to my rescue."

    "body": "I entered this building and an older white business man was leading me towards the elevators. Don't exactly remember what he was telling me but we passed this wall with terrarium inserts with blue glowing items. I made a remark on their beauty and he told me how important the color blue was. I entered the elevator while he stood in front and stayed outside the elevator and there was a lady inside the elevator waiting. I wanted to press a button but then she quickly pressed it before I could, although I didn't even know where I was headed. \n\nSuddenly the elevator shot upwards crazy fast and it made me scared af, holding onto the sides. When it reached the top, the elevator started swinging back and forth like a seesaw, as if it wasn't balanced. The doors opened and there was a platform hanging in front of it held by ropes from the ceiling. I screamed at the lady that we had to move quickly or we would die. I was terrified but jumped, barely making it to the platform and she was screaming in fear. I tried to coax her towards me but the ropes of the platform started to wear down so I had to move fast. I went ahead without looking back at her and making it across the platform to safe steady floor thinking I'd have to save myself first, hoping she'd make it too. I thought she died but then she was next to me, giving me some relief. \n\nWe went through glass doors and entered a regular corporate floor as if the scene before never happened. People were walking around working. Nobody looked as if it was strange. It was really high up too. I saw a stairwell leading down which I followed where I found two doors as if it was a movie theater, went inside but it was empty. When I backed out I found more stairs spiraling down, they got really tight at one point as if nobody was meant to walk them and nobody seemed to notice them either. \n\nThen I randomly ran into my best friend, who was happy and told me everything was fine, nothing to worry about and he was happily at work. He lead me through a hallway and offices. They reminded me of a mix between high school and uni, vague places I've been before. I saw people at desks working whom I recognized to be the people from my friend his internship, a theater production company - I know their faces because I worked with them a couple years back when I did catering for one of their plays 4 nights a week for 2 months. They didn't notice me and I didn't want to bother them with their work so I walked further. My friend said he had to get back to work so I went on ahead by myself. \n\nThen suddenly I noticed all this time the lady had been following me. I recalled her mentioning things like a vague voice in the background but it didn't click until I actually saw her next to me. I don't know what she said exactly though. Went down more stairs and eventually I got back on the ground floor as if nothing had happened. I went outside, the sun was shining and then it ended."

In the middle of it we heard a noise, obviously it was my girlfriend, there was no time to get dressed or pretend anything. My girlfriend was crying and shouting, she looked much more hurt than Ive ever seen her in real life, and her sister was like she didn't care much, an attitude like saying \"oh well, what r u gonna do? What's done its done\" and kind of laughing about the whole thing. \n\nAny comments? Thanks"

    "body": "In this dream, I was immersed in some sort of video game adventure. I was a Gandalf/sorcerer type figure. I entered a dungeon. At some point I unlocked a small room with a key, wherein there was a German shepherd sized black cat I needed to kill. I knew I had to kill it, but I had a hard time doing so. I was supposed to whack it with a stick, but every time it charged me I was never able to fully extend the range of my attack to deliver a killing blow. I only managed to half ass some weak strikes on its head. Fear and compassion got in the eay of me using my full strength on it. However this ultimately was still enough. I had debilitated the cat, it was now flailing around since I had clearly caused it some brain damage. I walked up to it and finished it off by strangling it, and then I saw it go to some kind of animal heaven\n\nIn this dream I was very reluctant to kill this animal, but I knew I had to as well. It was necessary for me to move on with my adventure. I had a hard time doing it but I eventually managed.\n\nWhat could this mean?"

I wake up to a text good morning from him. I shower and get ready, he picks me up, we go get breakfast tacos. We go to an outdoor mall and walk around and window shop. There's hand holding, hugs, and little kisses sprinkled throughout this interaction, just regular PDA stuff. He drops me off and I study/do homework until he texts that he's gotten home safe. I text back some variation of \"ok, i love you\" and he responds similarly. Some time passes and at night he facetimes me. We talk in bed until we fall asleep on the phone. \n\nThen the dream ends, and I wake up shaking and paranoid. I know this all sounds sweet and idyllic but the entire time I feel intense dread. I'm stiff and tense throughout the dream and he definitely picks up on it but doesn't comment.\n\nI'd like to note that the details of the dream change a little each time but it's mostly what I have described.\n\nI had something of a traumatic breakup with him, but it was almost a year ago and I haven't spoken to him or of him sense, and I even took measures to get rid of any reminders of him as a sort of cleansing. \n\nI haven't had any dreams of him since the breakup and I want this to go away. The experience is excruciating and painful, and I want it to stop so I'm hoping any interpretations will help.\n\nThanks and feel free to ask any questions."

I thought for sure I woke up from that because everything in the room was the exact same as when I fell asleep (night light, order of the throw pillows piled beside the bed) and a tall man in a grey suit walked in while she was sleeping beside of me and grabbed my arm and started pulling me out of the bed and I yelled ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going, I‚Äôm not ready‚Äù so guy let‚Äôs go and I fell half way off the bed but caught myself on the pile of pillows then scrambled to hold onto my girlfriend.

Now the part that scares me is that her mom woke us up in the morning and had us come downstairs to see that her cat had unexpectedly passed away overnight. Was I supposed to die that night but they took her cat instead of me? Was it all a coincidence? Do I need to see a shrink or a priest? I can‚Äôt bring myself to tell her about it, but I have a terrible feeling whenever I‚Äôm at her house since then. The worst part is when I woke up my arm felt like it had been pulled on."

She acted like she didn't really like me and wanted to know what I wanted. I told her to please let me see my love (to make it easier, let's call him Kevin) well she said ok, and we agreed I owe her one. Then she asked if I like him or something and I pretended I just needed his tutoring, she said ok and took me to him. \n\nHe was with other girls but he looked at me at first uncomfortable then shocked then he seemed kind of happy. he took my hand and said it could be used for his science experiment since it was so dirty. but then he acted as if he missed me and even said \"I miss you, I've been looking for you everywhere\" and it seemed genuine. then I had some realization I was dreaming and woke up."

But in this dream I was kidnapped and there was another girl there.  Only she was about 10/12yrs old, short dirty blonde hair with at home highlights. Was about 4' 7\" and roughly 90lbs. Very obviously not well cared for. Very dirty. I was my current age of 23. But we were out in the woods in a trailer home with a basement. We got a lot of packages, like Amazon type stuff and for whatever reason, I was allowed to sign for them. And one of the times that I went to sign for a package, it had my signature already. Obviously confused I looked at the mailman and she told me to sign next to it. So I did and it was identical. She asked if I was *my name* and I said yes. She told me to go with her and I refused at first cause of the little girl and I needed to save her. Well she forced me away and took me a hospital where I saw my mom and daughter again. I said I had to go back and save the girl. The police said they would work with me and help get her out safely. Now I'm not sure why we couldn't save her when I was saved. But we went back I saw her again and tried to get her and our captors came back and trapped us again in the dark.. I woke up at that pointbut now that im awake i described how she looked to my partner, I realize that younger girl, was me. Everything was identical to how I looked at that age. I'm not sure what that means, nothing I've searched helps or mentions younger self.. I'm very spiritual with angels. So I'm curious if there's something I'm supposed to understand about this dream, if so, what? Any help is greatly appreciated. Thank you."

    "body": "Tw:Blood\n\nSo, I keep having this weird dream about my left knee. I woke up in my bed and I was laying with some woman. It almost felt like she was interviewing me but I was laying on her. I had on a black business skirt and out of the blue she pointed to my leg and said \"What's that\" \nA small red dot appeared on my leg but looked like just a tiny bump. I said \"Oh it's just a pimple it's fine\"\n\nThe woman looked at me and said \"Could you please pop it?\" I was confused but reluctantly did. The pimple suddenly grew in size from the blood filling it making it almost the size of a American quarter if not larger. It finally popped and a thick stream of blood trickled down my leg. She told me to bandage it quickly because it could become infected. I got up, and she asked did I need help getting to my parents room. \"No no, I got it\" I told her. I in fact did not have it.\nAs soon as I closed the door I realized I was in my childhood home and tried dragging my leg to my parents room. The blood never touched the carpet and yet it still had blood coming. It kind of looked like as if someone had taken some red wine and popped a hole at the top and poured it slowly down my leg. Once I finally reached my parents room I knocked on the door and came in.\nI looked at my dad and asked for help. He looked at me confused then saw the blood. \"Your face is turning white. You're going to pass out\" He said as he got up from his bed slowly (For reference I am black so for my face to turn this white it was a bit. Weird. It wasn't white white you could still see the brown color of my skin but definitely pale.) \"NO no it's okay, tis just a flesh wound. All good\" (I only remember this because I laughed at it when I woke up)\n\nI hobbled to him and in the most ungraceful way possible almost fainted. My dad caught me and my mom yelled while my Aunt giggled to herself. My dad somehow caught me and my mom kept yelling \"Don't let her fall asleep. Don't let her fall asleep\" I was confused and just exhausted and cold. I remember slurring my words and saying \"No it's okay I'll just take like a 5 minute nap\"  My dad kept forcing me awake as  he tried to clean the wound. They finally got the bleeding to stop but did not bandage it. They told me to do it. I hobbled out of their room and accidentally collapsed. \n\nWhen I opened the door to my room, it revealed I was now outside of a mall. my friends yelled at me to catch up. I couldn't and some guy, who I don't remember but feels really familiar helped me. He paid attention during our mall visit every time I was collapsing. He also called me a dumb bitch whenever I didn't want to take a break from walking. When We left the mall we ended up down this weird street sewer lane concrete thingy. He looked back at me again and was gonna say something but my dumbass woke up."

They said we had to choke the snakes head to not get bitten. If you licked the head of the snake it would be very hot, this proved how venemous it was. I felt bad for the snake because it was about to die since everyone chocked it,  so i let it go. Then it bit my classmate and he died. But i didnt think about that because i was focused on catching a little mouse that i saw running around on the floor. But then the mouse got bit by the snake, and the mouse bit me. I got dizzy and it felt so real, i could really feel how sick i got and how i was completely out of it. I thought i was gonna die so i called 911 and they told me they couldnt help and i could call back after the weekend,so I got mad and clicked them. \n\nThen the dream kind of shifts. I was in a abandoned part of my school. It was a stairwell with a big grid you could climb up to the garret and the roof with. Now i was gonna go up to the garret with my friend and some unknown girl, and also a very tall man (about 2m). His skin was grey and he had black eyes, and also like knots all over his body. The only thing he wore was shorts. I dont remember me being afraid of him tho. Then we all climbed up. I saw this wall with names all over. At first i didnt get what it was but then i saw my aftername and 2021 written after.  I knew that was my uncle that died in 2021. So the wall had names written with everyone that died or was going to die. Then i saw my last name again but with a question mark after. I thought it meant i was about to die. Then i turned around to look at another wall. There was 4 names and they were all my exes. Suddenly they just disappeared, like they had never been there in the first place. Then the tall man told me im going to die now, and for some reason he pulled out the head of the snake. I looked at my phone to see what time i was going to die,and then i woke up."

He was confident, comfortable with calming me rather than exacerbating or instilling anxiety, charismatic, provided stability and was playful with me.\nIn my waking life, i have a very loving relationship, however, often times I feel more in touch with my masculine side than my male partner (something we occasionally joke about- He‚Äôs an extremely cautious, sensitive man who can be quite serious and easily offended).\n\nI felt madly in love with dream man and we (dream man &amp; I) spent the last half of the dream trying to negotiate a throuple with my waking partner due to the intensity of our connection. \nI felt awful in the dream, as though I was breaking my waking partners heart but ultimately did not want to give up this ‚Äúperfect man‚Äù for my waking/real partner.\nWhen I woke up next to my partner, I could feel myself tearing up - sad that I had left the dream character in my subconscious. Part of me was angry with my waking partner which felt irrational.\nI‚Äôm wondering if this dream is a my subconscious trying to tell me that I‚Äôm losing myself in my relationship or that I‚Äôm not willing to sacrifice what I want or who I want to be‚Ä¶ or maybe that I want to be with me more than my partner of 5 years?\n\nIt was a very confusing feeling, perhaps I‚Äôm misinterpreting what the animus is? \n(There is a needling feeling at times that my partner is wrong for me).\n\nThere was certainly a sexual aspect to the dream that was animalistic yet cautious not to upset my waking partner. However, this did not overshadow the deep connection we had that felt almost spiritual.\n\nI‚Äôm not extremely well versed on the Jungian archetypes, though from what I‚Äôve read I think it may have been my animus. I‚Äôm very interested to read thoughts and interpretations of others :)."

The past 3 nights in a row i‚Äôve been having the same dream, they‚Äôre different but consistent of the same thing. i‚Äôve been getting murdered. the first one was a home invasion. a man (i have no idea who he was but he was definitely over 6‚Äô5 and over 200 pounds) broke into my house he came into my room and tortured me. he would let me escape just to start the stabbing and his cutting my skin off again. everything was so vivid and i could feel the pain. when i finally escaped again my dad was there and told me i was lying and nothing was happening. when the murderer caught up to me he slammed me to the wall next to my dad and strapped a machete to his stomach (pinned me to the wall with knifes) and started motioning with his stomach and the machete was stabbing me while he used regular knifes to continue to stab me. i feel like i felt every pain in that dream but couldn‚Äôt wake up. like i was locked in the dream till i finally died \n\nthe next day had a similar dream not as bad as the one the night before. different person \nand the one last night was different weapons different area multiple people like i was being hunted."

I really wanted to go down and help/push her out so she could swim away and not die there, with me just watching it happen. But I was so scared it would kill me if I tired to, and I felt helpless. I was so heartbroken watching her being stuck there all alone, hurt and dying. I began to cry. \n\nI called the news to get some help but they did not care. I got home to read the news about the orca but found nothing else other than texts about how climate change kills them. \n\nAlso I knew the orca was not supposed to be in this kind of water but that it had gotten lost somehow. \n\nI would guess the orca is an aspect of myself. What I feel about my own situation in life. Either the orca dies here or I die helping it. Something has to come to an end. \n\nI would appreciate any insight if you would like to share some of your thoughts. \n\nIt‚Äôs like I am the orca but also the observer. I want to help push myself out of my situation where I am hurting and don‚Äôt feel like I belong, but at the same time I am scared of a part of me and my life that has to ‚Äúdie‚Äù/come to an end (me being scared of helping the orca since it could kill me). \n\nI felt stuck both as the observer and the orcas aspect. Not feeling like I have the power to take myself out of the situation, and when I finally called for help (news) I got ignored. \n\nI felt held back by fear. \n\nI feel very touched and emotional by the dream still."

    "body": "In my dream I had gone to visit a farm of a person who came from abroad(Europe) to open up a farm in my country(India). Let's name him John. John was a man in his 50s or 60s. He used to raise a lot of cows in his farms here in India. I went to visit him and stay with him for a couple of days to learn about his journey, his farm, and his life in general. \n\n\nSo it was around evening when i reached him. After sometime I noticed that he lived alone there. We spoke for a while, he wanted to show me his farm and how he raised his cows. He was a man of few words but the way he spoke with a smile it was clear that he was passionate for his work. He also had a dog coloured black and white which was at the farm. \n\n\nIt wasn't completely dark that time so there was a jungle nearby, he wanted to take me there for a while. So he took an axe and gave me a dagger just in case we run into some wild animals. \n\n\nHe took for me a short trip to the jungle and then all a sudden we started to hear noises from the farm. So we ran towards the farm. We saw that it was a deer who was licking John's dog we saw earlier. We just stood there as it seemed calm. I don't know what came into the deer's mind, but suddenly the deer bit off the dog's head and separated it from it's body. I was in shock. John who was holding his axe in an instant drove it across the deer's head and split it in half. \n\n\nIt was a gruesome scene to watch. John then went on to clean his axe as if nothing happened. I kept staring at the dead deer  and I noticed 3 puppies near the deer which looked identical to the dog that was killed. So I asked John about those puppies and he told me that his dog gave birth to those puppies. \nAfter that the dream ended. \n\nI hope you enjoyed reading it :) \n\nIt would be great if you could help me interpret this dream."

    "body": "In my dreams that is. I have frequent dreams that I can either fly or breathe under water. But I have to develop the ability throughout the dream. It starts with jumping a little higher, floating back to the ground, then I can levitate, and then fly (and then higher/for longer)\n\nWith the breathing under water it starts with breath holding, and then I take tiny little breaths and holding those. And then I just end up being able to breathe like normal. I‚Äôll just spend the dream at the bottom of a pool (or other body of water). Kinda floating, near the bottom. \n\nAnd in both types of dreams I can FEEL that I‚Äôm flying- or levitating/floating (both in the air and under the water)\n\nThey just happen so often and I wonder if there‚Äôs any meaning behind those things. And how can I make it happen more? With the flying ones, the jumping/levitating I start doing without trying. It‚Äôs just like ‚Äòoh, I‚Äôm jumping‚Äô, and then I realize I can fly and I ‚Äòactively fly‚Äô, I realize I‚Äôm dreaming eventually. But I can‚Äôt control anything other than the flying part. Can‚Äôt control the setting or circumstances, can‚Äôt control other actions, it‚Äôs just transportation, basically. Sometimes I stop and fly so much the rest of the dream falls away and I‚Äôll just be flying over random things. Like the pyramids, once. By flying I mean it‚Äôs just me going through the air. No wings or flying vehicles. I just jump off the ground and off I go.\n\nAnd with the underwater breathing I can‚Äôt control if someone got in the water too, so I wouldn‚Äôt call it lucid. \n\nAnd even when I realize I‚Äôm dreaming, I can‚Äôt change anything or control anything (beyond ‚Äòoh, I‚Äôm distractedly flying), I can‚Äôt wake up from them. I‚Äôll be trapped in nightmares and know I‚Äôm dreaming, but I‚Äôm stuck. I‚Äôve even died in my dreams and it‚Äôll be like I was dead but ‚Äòwoke up‚Äô in the dream and went about the rest of the dream (as it would have played out, like I said, I have zero input or control)\n\nI guess worth mentioning is that I have SEVERE insomnia, I‚Äôm heavily medicated for it so dreams can be more intense. I also am on other meds that disrupt certain process, and those effect nightmares and those- there are just quite dark things in my head‚Ä¶so I understand this may be quite a wall to scale to interpret my dreams since they‚Äôre subject to quite a few variables. I‚Äôll repeated the questions I had, so it‚Äôs more concise:\n\nWhat could dreams about flying mean? I try to bring it on but it doesn‚Äôt always work. Or work properly. And I mean, I‚Äôm happy with these parts. I tried really hard to take control over my dreams, but that‚Äôs not a thing I can do. I can just fly away when I‚Äôve built up the flight skill. \n\nWill it ever, or can I trigger the process of ‚Äòlearning‚Äô to fly?\n\nWhat could the dreams where I spend my time just floating down below the water mean? I really enjoy the water dreams too. I‚Äôm comfortable (which is extra because I‚Äôm chronic pain patient. Pain wakes me up‚Ä¶except for the dreams I get stuck in. My brains decided it has a dream queued, and that I‚Äôll be following the script until the story has been acted out.)\n\nI also get nightmares so severe that I usually can‚Äôt wake up from, or it‚Äôll be one of those where my sense are obscured. Like the sun is always in my eyes. I can‚Äôt see anything and I just try to shield my yes with the shade in creates. Or here‚Äôs one I absolutely hate- I‚Äôll need to go somewhere. Like what if I escaped from some insane kller monster and I‚Äôm try to run and OH SHIT, I don‚Äôt have shoes. The bads either took them or they took me when I was barefoot. Effective anti-escape method for me lol. My brain tries to outsmart itself. I also feel pain in dreams, I‚Äôd I‚Äôve woken with injuries. None are serious. But there is nothing around that could explain it. \n\nSorry this became so long, lol. \n\nThis post was meant to ask what dreams of flying (and flying is a skill I have to level lol) could mean anything and why can‚Äôt do  right away\n\nSame question applies to the floating below water. \n\nAnd- how can i grab immediate control of my dream\n\nAlso the nightmare aspect- the being taken and held til they‚Äôre done (and yeah those words were a thing lol, that I couldn‚Äôt leave until I‚Äôd rescued people. It was intense\n\nIf you read this all, I thank you \n\nI know it‚Äôs a lot to ask, but the meaning behind flying and floating under water? I‚Äôd love to hear some interactions \n\nJust. If you have a minute. Thanks in advance and sleep well üò¥ I appreciate you‚Äôve taken the time to consider and that means a lot. \n\nSweet dreams, fellow travelers"

I was also very tired because I had stayed up late and my brain and body wasn't really functioning properly. When I got to school, the dream just skipped to the near end of the school day when I had my 5th period and I was walking to class and in the dream my school was a 6 story buildings (irl it's actually 3 stories)with classrooms and because I was so tired, I was walking to my class that was on the 3rd floor but I just didn't stop walking and I went to the tallest floor and found a door. also the tallest floor was where the least classes happened so there were barely any people. I went through a door and it was kinda like that scene in Deltarune where I walk through the door and the door just disappears behind me and I'm just in a room with a single desk in the middle of it, then some kid who looked like a year 7 walked in from somewhere and just started doing his own stuff in a work book. In the room I was in, there were 0 doors or windows and I was just so confused. then an older man who looked very similar to my old Japanese teacher, walked in and didn't question why I was there. I started panicking a lot because I had to get to my class so I asked the man if there was a way to get to S11 (that was where my class was) and he said that he could teach me a teleporting spell to get there so then he got some paper and drew some lines that overlapped each other to look like a circle, then he got some glass with a small circle panel of glass in the middle (that glass had a different and more clear texture) he told me to write where I wanted to go underneath the circle on the paper and look through the clear part of the glass and align the clear circle with the one on the paper in my line of sight. then some green aura shit happened and instantly went away and he was like \"oopsy daisy it didn't work haha\" so I tried again and it DIDN'T WORK so I started panicking again because my teacher was probably going to yell at me because I had missed about 20 minutes of the class by now. and the man was like \"let's practice taikwondo!\" and the boy at the table and him started practising taikwondo while I was trying to do the spell over and over but it never worked. Then I joined the taikwondo practice (i did Taikwondo 3 years ago and quit) and we all started having fun. then I remembered that i had probably missed the entire 5th period and I started crying.\nthat's when I woke up\nwhat does any of that even mean??"

I'm 31f INFP. \n\nI was at a wharf and I was fishing with a man trying to catch fish to sell. I put my foot in the water and a tiny little fish burrowed it's way under my skin, it didn't hurt and I was not scared, it started swimming under my skin on my foot. I cut a little hole and squeezed it out and it flipped onto the wharf. It looked like a regular ocean fish, nothing special, grey in colour with a pink stripe. It was the size of a grain of rice. I asked the man what it would be worth and he said it was super rare and worth thousands. I asked if the fish might be my grandma who died as I felt she was watching me and he said yes, and then pointed to a pray mantis that was sitting on a flower that was visible through a whole in the wharf, and he said \"see there's your grandad sitting watching her\". The little fish flopped and propelled it's self back into the ocean and swam away. \n\nWe started to leave when I saw a big shiny beautiful fish. It was pink and orange iridescent and was 10 feet long, it looked like an eel but had the face of a koi fish. I asked the man what that one was and he told me they called them coyotes. I asked what they were worth as surely a fish so beautiful would get lots of money. He just laughed and said \"they're beautiful, but they're everywhere, we would get $10 at most, there's no point chasing that\" and then we left the wharf empty handed, but I felt ok. \n\nI have no idea what this means.

It was probably day 1 and the new professor came in and said that to see our people skills, he needed to test us like in an interview. He asked all of us to assemble in another room that was a lot far away.\n\nSo we all went there. And we were required to remove our shoes. We were waiting for the professor to arrive.

There are hundreds of people throughout the building color-coded by which floor they belong to, which the man explains is being organized by talents. He hands me a blue sweat suit, saying \"i think you're perfect for this floor, we're going to push you in particular to your limits.\" I took this as a shining compliment and motivation, not a scary intimidation. I don't remember what my particular talent was, but there was no audience, just tons of other performers being watched alongside me by the organizers. I remember it being a similar feeling to soccer try-outs I experienced as a kid/teenager, so i do know i was pushing myself, and that this was something i wanted so bad. When i finally got excused for a bathroom break, i was dripping in sweat and could barely walk- i was limping, even. As i was making my way to the blue floor's bathrooms, i saw they were all occupied, with other contenders sitting in a line for them. I realized this bathroom break was the only general break we had, and a limited time for it, so i decided heading to the bathroom on the red floor, which was a treacherous journey concerning my physical state. My body felt so painfully heavy. This was when the same man from the beginning rushed up to me announcing something along the lines of \"This is what we're looking for here- look at how hard she's worked!\" Which i say \"no, don't look at me. I'm dripping in sweat and exhausted.\" \nWhen i finally get to the vacant restrooms, my whole body felt as though it had been beaten up as i sit on the toilet. I couldn't even relieve myself/pee, i was just trying to rest. I heard others in the neighboring stalls crying, and conversations of some being found passed out in their stalls. For some reason, this motivated me even more to not burn out. As i was heading out of the bathroom to pick back up on my audition, i asked someone, \"what is all of this even for?\" To which he replied \"the circus, of course!\" \nI woke up expecting to be dripping in sweat, or needing to go to the restroom, but neither were true. I would usually assume these things are just signs of having a bad sleep, but i was physically well-rested. I would appreciate it so much if anyone knew what such a dream could symbolize."

And I was like ‚Äúoh you said something about *my partner*??‚Äù And then they got up and walked out. \n\nThen I walk outside my room to find another bed in the hall where my partner is and he is super upset. He thinks I had sex with my roommate and I tell him I didn‚Äôt but he is crying and doesn‚Äôt believe me. He keeps saying ‚ÄúI know you did‚Äù and then I woke up."

Used a phone for the Map App. As I was walking, I picked up a blanket from the ground and tossed it over my shoulder, but at the same time, I had some sort of needles or thorns in my Left Palm of my hand. \n\nAs I continue to walk, I then met with three women. They ask me about Darkness. I said \"Something you can't see.\" One of them squeeze my Left Hand and more needles/thorns came out a little.\n\n Afterwards, I keep walking and kept removing the needles/thorns from my Left Palm until Blood came out. It came out a lot and soon, Blood came out of my mouth. I then just fell on my side and looked up, Blood still coming out. The last thing I hear was one of the women yelling something couldn't tell what was she yelling about, but I can hear something running towards me. I then just wake up. \n\nThe interesting thing was that one of the women in the Dream was holding like a Flan on a stick, except the Caramel was on the bottom and the time of day was in the Evening that was moving towards the Night."

The dream was long so a TLDR of the beginning was that I was learning a spiritual dance and realized I didn‚Äôt feel natural at it and couldn‚Äôt get in touch with the spiritual side. Fast forward I‚Äôm with 4 friends and someone‚Äôs hands were wet and got onto some electrical things and we passed out. Then our spirits are in some clouds and it‚Äôs starting to spiral and I remember feeling calm and knowing it was going to be ok we were just going to die. So it‚Äôs like a downward spiral of clouds that our spirits are twisting in and we come out as ourselves with angel wings. I intuitively figured out if they were going to try to bring us back to life we‚Äôd have to go down into our bodies. I remember them trying to bring me back to life and I intuitively knew I had to try to take a breath from my body even though I wasn‚Äôt in it. When I tried I came back into my body. After this I was able to, we all were able to, do the spiritual dance with a more natural ability. I was dancing and having fun when I woke up."

    "body": "In my dream, my family and I moved into another house, which was like a village or subdivision. It was close to night, but there were still many people around. There was an old man sitting in front of his house, and a young boy, around 14 years old, seemed to take a liking to me. I, however, didn't pay much attention and went inside the house.\n\nInside, the house was already clean. My family decided to go somewhere to swim, but I chose to stay in the house and take a bath. They left, and I was the only person in the house. Suddenly, I heard someone, perhaps an older man, kidnapping my large floating fish that was suspended in the air (I'm not sure why I had such a fish). I decided to take a look but then suddenly blacked out.\n\nWhen I woke up, it was morning as if nothing had happened. I woke up in my bed and noticed that my body seemed to have matured. I didn't dwell on it and proceeded to go to the living room where my youngest sister, mom, and second-to-last younger sister were eating.\n\nThen, my mom handed me a huge folded picture and said, \"It just arrived.\" I opened it and was confused to see a class picture. Our school doesn't normally do that. When I checked the lower part of the picture, it indicated that it was a grade 12 picture, even though I remember being only a grade 11 student.\n\nI asked my mom about this, and she laughed and said I was crazy or making up a story. I asked her about various things like how our research at school went or how my 18th birthday was, but for some reason, when I returned to reality, I forgot about those details. It felt like they were significant in the dream but got filtered out upon waking.\n\nMy youngest sister also seemed to have matured physically, and my second-to-last younger sister, who liked going out, was already working, which confused me because my mom said she was already 18 and it was fine. I asked my mom, \"Then how old am I now?\" She replied, \"You're 19, turning 20,\" even though my 2nd to the last younger sister, who was said to be a working student, has a significant age gap of around 3 to 4 years with me.\n\n\nI went to school and noticed many changes, especially in my school uniform and the people around me. I was unsure whether I was still in grade 12 or already in college. I suddenly realized that I had lost one and a half years of my memory.\n\nAs I walked around, I encountered a few familiar faces and then some classmates who were also my classmates in reality. They appeared more mature, and I asked them to accompany me because I had many questions. We were probably less than 10, and there were still a few unfamiliar faces who were new friends of my ex-classmates.\n\nI explained to them that I had woken up and couldn't remember what happened after I fell asleep while we were still working on our research. For some reason, one of my male group mates mentioned that our defense didn't go well, which confused me. I felt like it failed because I hadn't been able to attend the defense. I told them the whole story but it seems they did not believe me.\n\nI asked many questions, but just like what happened with my mom, the answers seemed filtered. I could see them talking, but the sound was muted.\n\nI checked my conversation with my classmates/friends on my phone and noticed that the way I replied to them was very different from my usual responses to many people. It felt as though someone had been using my body for a year.\n\nWhile I was wandering around trying to find my way to school, a moment of consciousness came to me, and I realized I was on a long, high, or upper round structure that was collapsing, with many people still on it. I was confused about what was happening but luckily, I managed to escape before the structure completely collapsed.\n\nIn my dream, I was able to dream within my dream, which made it confusing. It felt like the dreams of my dream self and my actual self had merged, making me confused.\n\n\n\n------\nCan u tell me what does it mean? I've been dream continuously every night these past weeks until last month whete i couldn't have any dream at all."

We are at this really nice house, but idk why or how we were allowed to stay there. The surrounding area is infested with huge grizzley bears with their cubs. I noticed as we're going about our day that NO ONE will close any of the exterior doors or lock them up. I start to get really heated and yell at everyone to lock up the doors so the bears don't get in. My dad gaslights me and say \"you're overreacting, it's fine!\" My Husband and my Brother agree with him, and my husband tries to calm me down, but I just get more heated.\n\nWell, eventually the inevitable happens and the bears start to come in. They are aggressive and angry and try to kill us. I have to sneak around locking doors so more don't come in, but when I do, one of my family members leaves or enters and inevitably leaves the door wide open. Eventually, my brother leave and comes back with groceries and he's parked far away from the house. I get mad and ask why he thought it would be a good idea to park so far away from the house with bears closing in! It's not safe! Why didn't he just back up close to the porch? He looks at me like I'm stupid and says \"Well that's where you're suppose to park.\" \n\nWhile I'm helping unload groceries, a mom and her cubs gets between me and the house and I have to figure out a way to get around her so she doesn't see me as a threat to her or her cubs. I have do dive into bushes and really sneak around. When I get back in the house, all the doors are wide open again and the bears are everywhere.\n\nIt finally gets bad enough that my Dad grabs his rifle and I grab mine and we have to shoot them to keep them away. My gun kept jamming though, so I was getting really frustrated. Finally, I get it to work, but I can't hold it properly for some reason. Like, I'm not coordinated enough to hold it (which is ridiculous because it's my irl rifle and I shoot it just fine irl). \n\nFinally I can get a shot out and it only maimes one of the bears. This makes sense, because my rifle irl is not strong enough to take out a bear, but I was desperate and they were trying to kill us. The poor bear whines and is all pitiful. It's laying on the ground and really injured. It breaks my heart, so I try to go for the kill shot to put it out if it's misery and my gun jams again. I almost had an aneurysm. My dad had to give it the kill shot.\n\nEventually I wake up and I'm really heated. It's not the first time I've had a dream where I try to warn my family about danger and they ignore me or downplay the situation. Hell, I've had similar dreams about my co-workers not listening to my warnings or doing anything during a crisis. \nWhat does it mean???"

I was out celebrating with a group of friends (who, in real life, I haven't seen or spoken to in more than ten years). We were having a good time. We were taking a bus from one place to another. It seems to be a chartererd bus.\n\nSuddenly, we were on our way home in a car or van. I was driving. I was fading in and out of consciousness. I drove off the road through some brush. I couldn't stop. I heard one friend in the backseat say that she's really scared. I realized I was blacking out drunk.

    "body": "What do you think this means? Super long as it was really vivid. \n\nI was part of an old timey expedition of around 10 to 20 people through a muddy swamp. I was an unskilled labourer who was unfamiliar with the enviroment. There was often no path and we needed to wade through muddy water while fending off dangerous reptiles that would sneak up on us.\n\nThe water was infested with small crocodiles and these large dog sized lizards like creatures with sharp protruding teeth and thick crocodile like skin. The crew deterred them by striking them with sticks and didn't seem particulary worried by them. I however was unfamiliar and was very nervous. Somehow while defending myself I managed to grab a lizard creature from the water, holding it by the snout to keep its jaws closed. After some time it seemed to stop struggling and become friendly as i let it go and it would follow me around and would purr like a cat when i massaged the back of its neck.\n\nAs we continued through the swamp i realised we were there to escort a well dressed (noble?) lady, complete with a faded pink dress and white medieval head scarf, from a monastary deep in the swamp and to escort her to some unknown destination. To make the journey more difficult, she only.travelled inside a wooden horse drawn cart, filled with shelves or books. To get the cart through the more swampy parts of terrain required building makeshift tracks with planks of wood. \n\nDuring a particularly difficult swampy part of the journey while the crew were all frantically trying to move the cart of fend off the predatory fauna, i lose sight of my pet fanged lizard in the muddy waters. I put my hand into the water and move it around to try and attract its attention. However it missinterprets as prey (this bit is from the lizards perspective) and jumps out of the water to catch it, mid flight it realises its me and closes its jaws but one of its protruding fangs cuts along my extended arm and rips open my neck. Unsure if i died or survived."

    "body": "&amp;#x200B;\n\n\\[An atheist asked 'Can God create a stone, which He cannot lift?'\\]\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSwami  replied: Your question indicates that God is defined as omnipotent. In fact, we define God so. For example - Assume that we have given a  statement that a particular king can punish any citizen in his kingdom.  You may put the same question, 'Can that king punish a citizen, whom he cannot punish?' Anybody can understand that this question is meaningless based on crooked logic. Logic can be good or crooked. We should base all the questions and statements on good logic. Here, we have defined the king as omnipotent limited to a particular context in punishing any citizen existing in the kingdom. In such case, a citizen, who cannot be punished cannot exist in the kingdom. A non-existent person cannot become the basis of your question.\n\n Similarly, any stone created by God must be lifted by God to prove that God is omnipotent. In such case, a stone that cannot be lifted by God should be created by somebody other than God. Since God alone is the creator of this entire universe, this possibility cannot exist. Since God could not create a stone that cannot be lifted by Him, the omnipotence of God is contradicted. If God creates a stone that cannot be lifted by Him, the inability of God to lift such a stone also contradicts the omnipotence of God. This is called as mutual contradiction (Anyonya Vyaaghaata) in logic. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSuch a mutual contradiction does not exist by itself since it is created by your crooked intelligence only. When your question is based on good logic and the answer given by us is based on crooked logic, then, you can criticize us. Now, the situation is reverse and we have to criticize your crooked logic only. The reason is that the mutual contradiction is created already by yourself in your question itself and such mutual contradiction is not created by us in our answer. Hence, there is no need of giving defectless answer to a defective question.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n If you still insist, we can give the answer based on the same mutual contradiction. You should not find fault with the mutual contradiction existing in our answer since your question also contains the same defect.The suitable answer for your question is: God can create a stone that cannot  be lifted by Him and God can lift any stone. You have to satisfy with our defective answer for your defective question. The blind bride should  be married with the blind bridegroom. You cannot point out at the blindness of the bride or groom since both are blind. The answer without  any defect for your defectless question like 'Can God create a stone that cannot be lifted by any living being other than Him?' would be that God can create any stone that cannot be lifted by any other living being. The human beings also create a house, but, such house cannot be lifted by the same human beings. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTherefore, the human being is not omnipotent. Since God is omnipotent such type of possibility will not arise in the case of God. Lord Krishna, God in human form, created this entire universe, which contains Govardhana Mountain. This mountain was lifted by God Krishna, which cannot be lifted by any other human being. Therefore, we say that Krishna is God in human form whereas other human beings are not God. Hence, we should base the subject of philosophy related to God on good logic, which is scientific and systematic without defects like mutual contradiction, ad-infinitum etc.The example for ad-infinitum is that an endless chain is created in statements like 'which is the cause for God?' In the analysis of creation, you may go on stating the cause for every cause. You may say that the cause for earth is water. The cause for water is fire. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nThe cause for fire is air. The cause for air is space. The cause for space is God (Atmana Aakashah... Veda). You should stop at a particular cause, which has no cause. If you go on giving cause to every cause, the chain will never end. Such a defect is called as ad-infinitum (Anavasthaa). To remove this defect, we have to stop at some cause, which is called as the ultimate cause i.e., the God. Hence, the subject of philosophy (Vedanta) should be always based on good logic (Sat tarka) only. Shankara told this point that bad crooked logic should be stopped and good logic should be followed in any discussion (Dustarkah suviramyataam shrutimatah tarkonu sandhiyataam...)."

So I first saw Sarah and then Charlie which made eye contact with and made me a beautiful smile, and I woke up. Since this dream I couldn't not think of her. There was something making me wondering what was going on. Then the second dream occured. I was in a classroom seating next to her, at her right, and she turned toward me, made a beautiful smile and touch my hands, and I felt love through me, something I had never felt in real life, then I was outside walking, and I saw her, she was seating on a bench and I was watching her from behind. It looks like she was waiting. And then I woke up. \n\nNow the context. The girl exist in real life, she was at my elementary school, but at that time I didn't fall in love with her. Since the elementary school I have never seen her. I told my best friend what does this dream mean and he told me MAYBE she was a soulmate. I  not sure if soulmate is real or not but, he told me MAYBE I needed to contact her.\n\nWhat I did is, I contacted her on her Instagram, told her who I was in case she remembered me. She answered, but she didn't make long messages. She said she didn't like to text people, so I thought I was annoying her so I apologize and said I wouldn't bother her, but she replied and said I was not bothering but she really didn't like to talk to people but would rather talk to them directly. Since I haven't spoken to her. \n\nI know this is long but, why do you think of the dream ? What should I do according to you ? If you want more information ask me in the comments I'll answer you !

During one community gathering, he realized that he can do whatever he wants, so he took a log and decided to escape this place.

Their skin was severely injured, but their clothes were in fine condition.

The glass enclosure was gone and I became worried about the Scorpions running free on my bedroom, so I ask the person with me to help me find them, however I just see the small/male Scorpion and a Scolopendra (Centipede) running on the floor.\n\nI chase the Scorpion, cornered and then killed it with poison spray.\n\nI grew worried about the Scolopendra, but I didn't find it.\n\n\n**Considerations**\n\nI'm on insomnia medicines and I rarely remember my dreams.\n\nI've never seen a Scorpion in person in my life, just in videos and I have encountered a Scolopendra just once many many many moons ago.\n\nI love wildlife documentaries, biology, entomology etc. and I am really not afraid of any animal except Scolopendras, they actually disgust me since I saw pictures of their bite's aftermaths or those giants one eating snakes and catching bats mid fly. I am not sure if female Scorpions are bigger than males, but since this seem to be the case for most Spiders I think my brain played like that.\n\nHowever it has been a while since I last saw a video about wildlife and lately, the dreams I remember having, are most based on real problems I'm facing right now, so this vivid dream I just had seems very out of place.\n\nI don't remember who was the person in the dream with me, but I have a feeling I know who could be, but besides watching the Scorpions and me asking them for help they didn't play a bigger role in the dream."

The dream started with me in my gym greeting a friend, but he looked like he was dead (pale with blue veins popping on his face). After that me, my father and mother are in my car and at a gas station. The place was very quiet and had a horrific vibe to it. As we were going further into the parking lot I saw that there are dead people and blood on the ground, like they were shot. My mother left the car after and I didn‚Äôt want her to go because they would blame us for the murders. My father also left the car and yes, we were blamed for the murders and around my car were so many people protesting and trying to get inside. Panicking, I left the gas station, and in my mirror I saw that the dead people are not dead and are standing up."

I heard thuds and a hissing-like sound and then an aligator attecked us. It was more of a tension dream than gore and horror. I awoke from that before anyrhing tragic happened.\n\nThis time I awoke around 4am and couldn't go back to sleep. Basically, my fsther was cutting grass outside. I was in my room so I didn't see anything go down. Heard my grandmother calling my name. I knew something bad happened, I knew my dad died. She said we have to go out and collwct what remained of him. A couple of crocodiles I think, had attacked him and ripped him apart. And it was rather detailed unfortunately. A leg torn off, veushed skull, degloved skin ripped of arm. We dropped his parts in a basket that I presumably carried inside after. Presumably because after I saw the crocs in the distance eyeing us up, I awoke. It was a dream but god damn did the feeling of carrying his dead weight and the feeling of blood and loose, chewed skin touching me stayed with me.\n\nSo yeah, I have no clue whether or not it could mean anything.

The first 10 were traumatic nightmares and the 11th dream felt like euphoric bliss. I haven‚Äôt had a single dream since and it‚Äôs been about a week. \n\nDue to the deeply personal nature of the nightmares, I‚Äôve reduced them to the fears they represent:\n1. Being used\n2. Losing my parents\n3. Being sexually assaulted\n4. Choosing the wrong life partner\n5. Being trapped in an unhealthy relationship\n6. Losing my head (literally and figuratively)\n7. Being rejected \n8. Becoming unsightly\n9. Being embarrassed publicly \n10. Relapsing and needing my parents to help me pick up the pieces of my life\n\n(Context) I started dating someone recently and I‚Äôm feeling things I haven‚Äôt felt in a long time. All signs indicate this could be the beginning of something really special. Here‚Äôs my anti-nightmare:\n\n11. He &amp; I are preparing for our upcoming date. We run into each other 3 times around town. The 3rd time we bump into each other is in a grocery store. We lock eyes while we‚Äôre walking down the aisle and I see he has 2 Costco-sized flats full of groceries for us. I‚Äôm flooded with the sense that he understands and cares for me deeply (I hate grocery shopping and acts of service is one of my top love languages). He embraces me, reassures me, picks me up and spins me around. As we‚Äôre spinning, the grocery store fades into a pale blue ether and suddenly we are in the sky. My entire being is filled with a sense of anti-gravity euphoria. \n\nWhen I woke up I cried, partially from the relief of not having another nightmare and partially from how inexplicably pure and beautiful those final moments of the dream felt. I haven‚Äôt had a single bad dream since and it‚Äôs been about a week. \n\nWhat would you make of it if you were me? Is it a green light for the new guy in my life, or does he represent my hope for a healthy relationship? I‚Äôm open to any and all interpretations. \n\nSide Note: The number of dreams, 11, is significant to me. I have a tattoo of 11:11 on my ribs in memory of my ex-boyfriend who died of an overdose. Whenever I catch an 11:11, I always try to check in with God and say a little prayer. In essence, the number 11 to me represents God‚Äôs supplication. \n\nFor those who believe in a higher power, would you say it‚Äôs possible God may be supplying me with a healthy partner and loving relationship?

And she basically wanted me to ‚Äúdie painfully, and slowly‚Äù. I sought out help with my brother and he was stab as he trying to figure out what was going on. In the dream, I called out for my younger sister so we could get help but i found her mangled in a room close to death. I ended up running to my neighbors house to seek help, but nobody could help me. I woke myself up when I felt like I was going to have to die.\n\n(My Reality)\n\nI‚Äôm a 20 year old female who lives with their mother and 3 siblings. I‚Äôm currently in the process of trying to move out (while in college) but it‚Äôs been very difficult as we all know it‚Äôs expensive to generally live.\n\nMe and my mom fell out back in 2022 as I was fed up with her abusing me in anyway, that she could find. CPS has been involved, family members have also been involved but from 13 until now I‚Äôve exhausted all my resources for help. \n\nSept 13th 2022.. I was 19 and told my mom firmly for the first time to not put her hands on me and she didn‚Äôt appreciate it.. not one bit. So you can imagine when I went to go get help from other people she basically denied anything that happened, even when there was witnesses. Even the people I would seek help from also have a hard time believing what me and my siblings say about my mom. \n\nI‚Äôve spoken to my mom since that day but it‚Äôs been nothing but her bashing me and telling me that I am ruining her life. Like I really can‚Äôt hold a conversation with her without yelling being involved.\n\nI‚Äôve been to therapy and I have ways I use to help myself mentally relax and escape my stress. Therapy actually helped me realize that the absence of my father wasn‚Äôt my source of anxiety and depression. It was really my mom.\n\nI‚Äôve experienced an awful amount of abuse and trauma from her. My siblings have all experienced some type of abuse but i can only speak for myself as I was the only one that experienced my mother physically. But like I said from 13 up until 19 I‚Äôve experienced some type of abuse. I was gaslighted into believing it was just discipline but giving a child a black eye isn‚Äôt.. \n\nI won‚Äôt go into much detail as it can be triggering for someone but I‚Äôve also been raped, molested, and sexually assaulted.. and each time I tried to speak about it to my mom, I would be ‚Äúdisciplined‚Äù for it especially when it came to the men she brought around. \n\nMy reality isn‚Äôt the worst but it‚Äôs something that hurts, I can admit. However, I‚Äôm just trying to move forward with my life and get myself in a better position. Yet, these dreams man‚Ä¶\n\nThis is probably the third or fourth dream I‚Äôve had from April of this year until now that‚Äôs displayed to me my mom trying to murder me. I have no idea what this means but considering what I‚Äôve been through with her maybe it‚Äôs my subconscious, trying to talk to me? However, the consistency of experience this type of dream is very exhausting as I don‚Äôt want to go to sleep anymore and I can‚Äôt sleep by myself sometimes."

    "body": "I just woke up from a dream a few minutes ago that really shook me to my core. Which probably sounds ridiculous when you read what happened. But it's really bothering me. \n\nSo before I get into the dream, I have really bad migraines and a lot of other issues that may or may not be related to a head injury caused by my ex or what the doctors have suspected could possibly be blood cancer or some autoimmune disorder of some kind. \n\n\n\nThe dream: \n\nI'm driving down a familiar road in my town with my partner and best friend who are almost always in my car while I'm driving (I have mild agoraphobia so they go everywhere with me) \n\nSuddenly my head starts hurting really really bad, my vision starts blacking out, and my hearing starts fluctuating in and out. \n\nUp ahead on this road there is what I mumble to my partner in the passenger seat as a DWI checkpoint, which is uncommon in this area. The reason I suspect that is because I see police lights on the police cars blinking and police walking up to a line of cars in front of me at this light in my neighborhood. They're stopping and checking everyone.\n\n And as I get closer I slam on the breaks and pull my car completely into the grass over the curb, over the sidewalk and slam it in park. The policeman that just spoke to the car in front comes up and he's looking very concerned. \n\nI keep closing my eyes really hard to try to make the pain stop and clear my vision so he doesn't think I'm under the influence. And I barely hear him ask multiple times if I'm okay and I tell him that my head really hurts and I didn't want to hurt anyone in front of us in line if I blacked out. \n\nAnd he keeps asking questions and I see his lips moving but I'm hearing nothing but ringing in my ears, no other sound. My partner texts me, \"he asked if you have had a head injury recently\" and I texted him back as quickly as I could \"tell him yes, four years ago\" and I look back to the police man and he is signing vigorously at me after asking me three more times if I'm okay and my hearing is going in and out again. \n\nSo I can make out enough words to know what he's asking. But I can't speak now, I can't keep my eyes open very long, and my hearing is almost completely gone. But the policeman keeps signing at me and I keep mumbling \"I'm sorry I don't understand, I don't know sign language and I can't hear you\" \n\nAnd my dog barking in her sleep about ten minutes ago woke me up. \n\nI told my partner I had no idea what the man was signing to me but I found myself googling sign language and I found what he was signing to me over and over again. \"You're not safe, get help. Something is wrong\" \n\nBut when I woke up, I couldn't even remember what the sign language was because I don't know it. But something in my head clearly knows that's what it was even after I woke up.\n\n So my question is, is that my brain just telling me to get my symptoms checked more or is it a spiritual thing like someone reaching out to get me to take this more seriously than I am? Because I'm losing my mind right now trying to figure it out and I saw a doctor yesterday and they have no idea what's wrong with me after a year of testing. \n\nSorry this is chaotic because I had to type it out before I forgot all the details but this is something that's baffling me and my partner. Usually my dreams are dark, scary, PTSD dreams but this one was very different. It wasn't super scary like the others just a little anxiety inducing. \n\n\nThank you for reading. Let me know what you think, even if you think I'll think it's ridiculous. I need to know. üñ§üñ§ü§òü§ò"

    "body": "Hi everyone, \n\nPlease be patient with me as this is my first time ever seeking something like this. Just based on how weird and random my dreams usually are I've never really been a believer that they have much meaning. But last night I had a really vivid dream that's kind of been on my mind all day and it's something I feel like could use a little more analysis.\n\nI also want to give the trigger warning that this dream directly involves attempted suicide. A little context about myself, if it helps: I have been battling depression for a long time. I've gotten to the point of being suicidal before, I've never actually attempted but I had made plans in the past. I'm okay now and haven't had those thoughts or been that low in a while, but depression is still something I deal with regularly.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nOk, onto the dream:\n\nThere was some kind of natural disaster that was forecasted or expected to happen. It was either a blizzard was coming, or a volcano was erupting. I don't remember exactly which, I'm almost certain it was a volcano but I'm also fairly certain that later on in the dream I was dealing with snow so I'm not exactly sure which it was. Anyway, I was going to use this as a really strange opportunity to k\\*ll myself. The idea was I'd cover myself in a thick blanket and fall asleep, and while I slept, significant amounts of snow (blizzard) or ash (volcano) would come in through the windows and gather in the room, piling onto the blanket I was under, burying and suffocating me while I slept.\n\nAnd that's sort of what happened. Except, within the dream, I woke up while this was going on. And I had that feeling sort of like how you feel if you wake up earlier than you wanted to, and are trying to will yourself to go back to sleep for a couple more hours. But sometimes you're just awake and have to get out of bed. It was sort of that feeling, where I wanted so badly to just fall back asleep and let my plan take its course. But there was also an urge to dig myself out before it was too late. And I remember feeling a sense of disappointment in myself, and that this was sort of a point of no return where if I dug myself out I'd be giving up on that plan. \n\nBut that's what I did, I pushed through the blanket and dug through the snow(?). This is where I get confused on what disaster was happening, because I'm fairly certain it was a volcano (I don't even live near a volcano though so I don't know where that came from) but I'm pretty sure the substance I was digging through was snow, it just wasn't cold. Regardless, I dug myself out and saved myself at the last possible moment, rather than falling back to sleep (within the dream) and letting my plan take its course.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd that's about where the dream ended before transitioning to an entirely different and unrelated dream that I don't remember all that well. Like I said, normally I don't pay much mind to my dreams, they don't usually make much sense and I often completely forget them soon after waking up. But this one was really vivid, and incredibly morbid and disturbing, and has been sort of sitting with me all day. There is of course an obvious interpretation, that despite my ongoing depression and previous ideations, maybe I value life more than I think and wouldn't actually want to die if it came down to it. But I also feel like there could be something more. I don't really know. I have 0 experience with dream interpretation or anything of the sort and would really appreciate some insight on this.\n\nThank you in advance for anyone who takes the time.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR: In my dream I attempted suicide (in a very strange way) but saved myself at the last possible opportunity."

Idk if he was trying to make a point or what. He also did a second one in a parking lot which had a Nintendo ds shipping truck from the early 2000s parked in it. Afterward, I was wearing these novelty slippers while walking home (one had Garfield's face on it and the other had Bill Murray's face). Dan had been handing out Garfield merchandise during the meet and greet but everyone else had thrown theirs in the trash so I started rifling through it for the Garfield merch because I really like Garfield. Dan came over and revealed he was wearing the SAME Garfield slippers (but his were both Garfield. He was not wearing a Bill Murray slipper). We had a conversation about Bill Murray's live action Garfield movies and started talking about how he didn't really like Bill Murray very much but he really liked his work as well as the Garfield movie he did. I started trying to seduce him and then when I got home it was revealed that my brother killed my whole family with a steak knife and then I had to kill HIM to defend myself. He then turned into a ghost and then started harassing me but my love for Dan Aykroyd saved me and then I went to this school dance with my ghost brother following me.

I figured I can come on Reddit to have some clues to what these things may mean moving forward instead of just forgetting about them. This journey will hopefully be an enjoyable and enlightening one with the Reddit community. Thank you, Peace &amp; Light. ‚ô•Ô∏è \n\nI was in a motel in California. I was with several others who felt like friends but their faces were not people I knew in my waking life. We were all pretty much hanging out and it felt as though we were all traveling together trying to figure things out ( a solid place to stay/nomadic lifestyle collective) it was late in the evening and it felt like there was going to be a huge event in the city that supposedly was held every year. Kind of felt like a Mardi Gras crowd &amp; type of celebration. Nobody was really in the motel parking lot and it was quiet throughout the motel until the next morning. I went to sleep and I woke up within my dream, opened the motel room door and there was a MASS amount of people outside. I mean you couldn‚Äôt see the streets it was so many people and cars. The city had started its extravaganza.\n Everyone in our motel room was dressed and deciding on where everyone was going to go and what we were all doing that day whether some had to do their own thing and some of us were going to group together, but as I walked outside on the second floor terrace to look down to the parking lot, i saw a police officer on duty loading up his camera app, facing himself and then it quickly got angled to me and he began recording and zooming in. I felt anxious and like I was getting caught for something and said I have to go. I headed out and woke up in my waking life. I went back to sleep again in my waking life and the dream continued. I was in the back seat laying down talking to the man driving the vehicle. I was evening time and he seemed to be an Uber driver and we were talking about pricing and how much people were willing to pay for the all day driver expense during these types of events but rather pay surcharges etc. one specific sentence I remember him saying to me was ‚Äú yes people aren‚Äôt willing to pay $250 to be driven anywhere/all day in the city anymore, maybe $120-$125.‚Äù I told him I couldn‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs that low these days. And then I woke up in real time again. \n\nSuper random dream."

They approached me and we walked down the road to a cliff-side we all hopped inside this big cardboard box and watched the sunrise together and the dream ended. \n\nIt was a relaxed dream and I‚Äôve loved snow leopards ever sense :) \n\nI want to know what you guys make of this ^^ this dream happened years ago but never the less it‚Äôs interesting"

    "body": "I had a nightmare that I was driving my car going through a tunnel then all of a sudden I was in the passenger seat and there was no one in the driver seat but the car was moving and about to hit another car and cause an accident in the tunnel. I kept trying to get out of the passenger seat into the drivers but I was stuck so I tried steering the car from the passenger side but I wasn‚Äôt successful and caused a huge accident by colliding with a couple cars. No one was hurt or injured. When the police arrived no one believed my story of being trapped in the passenger side and there was no footage from the accident and I found out from the police my car insurance was canceled days ago without my knowledge so I was liable for all the damage and charges. \n\nWhat does this mean?"

Essentially at two points in the dream I stuck my hand out to feel a space which now thar I think about it might have been where the spirit was standing and it led to repeated static shocks to my fingers. The shocks didn‚Äôt hurt nor did they startle me it was a strange sense of wonder while it happened. Sadly before much more happened i had to wake up and start my day."

    "body": "Last night, I had a very weird dream I remember vividly. English is not my first language.\n\nThe dream:\n\nI (33F) was in my twenties with my college friends and boyfriend of the time, and he was kissing all of our girl friends. I was feeling jealous and tried to stop him from this, but I also saw a friend going into a tunnel outdoor, very small, where she found a room at the end of it. I followed her. \n\nShe found 3 babies, but didn't see the mother. She took one of the babies, because she thought it was alone. But I saw the mom, and warn her that it was a siren (very colorful and bright tail btw). \n\nI found my boyfriend right after and (tried?) to have sex, but it didn't happen because the sirens (many of them) found all of us and wanted the baby back. Our friend didn't want to give it back so the sirens told us they would kill all of the girls of our group.\n\nWe hid under a blanket, but I warn my friends not to look at the siren's eyes because they were deadly. Sadly, they did and my boyfriend tried to kill me (with sex?! but didn't happen).\n\nEvery boy disappeared, dead maybe, and the sirens took all of the girls to a \"camp\", like a prison, where we had to pay in time for our sins. Every sins we made in our life and generations before. They told me I could get out in a month. I found my phone and my actual boyfriend and stepdaughter called me, asking where I was. I remembered my actual life and managed to escape. \n\nThen I don't remember vivid details from there.\n\n---\n\nMy dreams are often constructed this way: I dream of my early 20s and old boyfriend and suddenly I remember my actual life and panic.\n\nIf there's a meaning, I would love to know it! :)"

    "body": "Last night I had a dream that my life was peaceful. \n\nI dreamed that I bought a small lot of land with a small house on it. The house was one bedroom with a kitchen and bathroom. \n\nIn this dream I decided that I had enough space for some farm animals. I ended up having a cow with short horns that was black and white, a goat with long horns that was grayish white and two ducks with yellow beaks and yellow feet. \n\nFor some reason the cow was my favorite. I don‚Äôt know why but she was. I built a stable for her right under my bedroom window and she was able to go walk around the farm freely during the day. The other animals were not able to do that. \n\nAfter building a stable for the cow I realized I didn‚Äôt have a stable for the goat and ducks. I built a stable for them as an after thought. Their stable was one pen and they all stayed together. \n\nMy sister who in the dream represented my old life. She was trying to get me to come back to the chaos and unpredictable style I used to be and she didn‚Äôt understand why I wanted to live on this farm. She even asked about the cow. ‚ÄúWhy is that one out of the pen?‚Äù And I told her she was allowed to roam freely. In my dream I was at peace but when my sister came I felt a bit of anxiety because she‚Äôs my older sister and I usually listen to her but this time I just wanted to be happy and stay on my small farm in my shabby house with my animals. \n\nI realized late in the dream while my sister was talking to me that I never fed my animals. The goat and ducks were waiting patiently for their food and they would patiently wait forever. That‚Äôs what I felt where as the cow came in and said this is my food over here. The was a bucket made out of metal attached to the wall under the kitchen window with milk in it. The goat and ducks were looking at me to feed them and the cow just made her food appear. \n\nAfter this I woke up. The cow was eating before I woke up. \n\nI have gone through a huge flip in mood recently. I am calmer and happier with energy and motivation like never before. Yelling bothers me and I don‚Äôt like negativity anymore or talking about people. I have also been trying to form new routines to match my new self because my old routines were very chaotic and unorganized. I wasn‚Äôt happy I fearful and anxious and never listened to myself. Sometimes I forget stuff but once I notice it I fix it right away."

Without a doubt it's my sign from the universe to send me that message. \n\nLast night's sunset dream was different though. I watched the sunset above a volcano with some friends (who I dont recognize). when I got home, my ex was there waiting for me and excited. in the dream, we decided to get back together and we were taking it slow. i told her to wait outside on the porch while I went to get us water. when i went outside to meet her ‚Ä¶. I saw a gorgeous sunset above us. she and I were in awe. she started running around the neighborhood go find a better view and i followed her. the best view turned out to be at my porch. so we went back, but it was close to being gone. we were happy and childlike. \n\ndoes this sunset dream still mean the end of my relationship, giving me a sign its officially over? or is it a different meaning now that she was there in the dream with me?"

    "body": "So we were on a trip to Portugal on some very exotic island, the children who were there were on a mechanical oil rig type of building. We were all having fun till a chaos started. My stubborn friend tried to jump a fence I looked and laughed while a teacher spotted him(the teacher was my old strict catechister) my friend ran back down and ran past me with the others stepping on my abdomen as a 'joke', I felt alot of pain. This island had constant ships coming to drop sand on the portside, I saw one and assumed it was just another one, but it was our ship back home. I ignored it and slept. By the time I woke up I was here with some Portuguese children that looked very poor and were working very hard on the port of the island. I saw no one I recognised panicked. I ran to ask some boy he told me out ship left and later that day someone told me the next one will be in 70 days. This broke my heart. I could m not contact my mum back home and panicked so hard. Some guy came and told me to also get working, I kept looking at the ships that came ashore and reminiscing about goin back home. I went off to work with the other kids and slept till the next day, my. Clothes were dirty and torn. The whole port was a system of moving stuff, we were gettin moved throughout the place with tons of lift systems. I even met an old friend there. We walked back into the mainland seeing weird animals, like wolfs infused with crystal bars in their backs. The only thing I could worry about is that I couldn't make it back home to make my exams and hit a high rank in valorant before the act ends in 15 days. Something happened and this led to a another ship comin which I instantly jumped on. Everyone was acting normal. The inside looked like a bus. And I went to the upper level where I screamed halloo to the 8 people sitting there. I talked to them for a long time about what happened and my experiences and some girl really liked me, 2 policewomen were also there having a never ending quarrel. We took off back home and the last thing I remember is the 2 policewomen getting dropped off. This dream made me very uncomfortable and I felt pain and seen as dreams always point so something subconscious I would like to know the meaning of it all."

And in the queue I saw this gorgeous girl infront of me. I knew I really wanted to talk to her etc. I talked to her using something that happened around us. We got talking, about yoga and said we were enjoying each others company and she teased me about being nervous lol. We got to the front of the queue and the place we were queuing for was a big tent and inside was a sort of naked dance party? The girl I was talking with got naked no problem but when the people at the party told me I need to get naked, I was hesitant and made a joke that my clothes were stuck to me. I flashed forward to later on and I was on the floor above. I was sitting and talking with the girl (now fully dressed again) and this older woman I don't recognise. Another flash forward and we were left cause the people at the party were trying to get us to stay. But me and the girl (now naked again) left the tent and there was a mob of people throwing things at the tent, angry about the nudity. The girl I was with walked towards the crowd, usibg her clothes she took off to cover herself went towards a guy who looked like her father and he was yelling at her for doing this. I later spoke to two people and was telling them how this was my chance to have a girlfriend, find someone I like and lose my virginity. The people I was talking to reenacted a scene in a film of the characters singing about being sad and lonely. I then said to them while pointing, \"That sums up my adult life, and I'm fucking sick of it!\" Then walked off, end of dream.\n Please help me understand this dream thank you guys."

But we tossed and turned all night. We struggled to grasp what was real and what was dreamland. After chatting more about it we realized that we both remember hearing music outside of my room but thinking it was a dream. We individually remember having dreams of parties and gatherings. We saw people moving under the doorway. All of this was happening but it felt like neither of us had the option to go see what was going on outside of my room. We remember the room was a blue tint like a moonlit room or more like that blue hue of the early early morning. Almost like a filter. At one point the electricity even went out. We felt heavy, exhausted, glued to the bed but not out of fear or anxiety. We just felt like we weren‚Äôt supposed to leave. It actually never crossed our minds.

In the dream, we were in an old house that I didn't recognise as any specific house, and trying to find a way out.\n\nIt's not a very subtle dream, the whole thing obviously represents our falling out.

I told him that jeeps are stupid, but then I realized I was driving a jeep as well. \nThen I was with my niece, who is now pregnant in real life, and we were walking to a taqueria right outside of my job. That's when I saw a jacked up beige GMC Sierra and knew that it was mine. The word Sassy or Sassylicious was written on the side with the emblem stickers lol. Well my niece and I got inside and I was backing it up into another parking space as I was telling her that I was going to give it to my mom. My niece said she wanted to get something sweet like a cinnamon bun, but I told her let's get a taco first. After our food we were outside an elementary school, and I knew my mom was inside. When we got inside, the interior of the building is a medical waiting/reception area. \nMy niece and I tell my mom we wanted to go outside and explore while she waited. So, we go outside to this older looking playground.\nI remember there was this old saw horse thing with the spring at the bottom that you can ride on, but instead of a horse it was a frog. Right beside this was a little clean stream that wasn't much more than a puddle.\nMy niece and I followed the stream into a clearing, that opened up into a huge expanse of beautiful clear blue water. I could see straight down into the bottom of the water before me, and shadows laying on the lake floor. We saw people floating on the surface and enjoying the sunny day. \nI remember looking down and realizing it was a steep drop off to the water below; and it was surrounded by rugged white rock. I turned and saw that there was also a stretch of still lake water besides us as well. I told my niece that we have to find a way down to go swimming too, and the I woke up. \nWhat could this mean?\n\nAlso for reference, my mom has been in the hospital for the last 22 days and I have been staying with her. Her condition has improved and we are looking at a discharge date very soon. I also broke up with my ex and left a very toxic enviroment somewhat recently. \nAlso I was walking around the grounds yesterday, after an especially bad argument when out of nowhere a Texas Mockingbird landed on my head/shoulder. Could this be a factor into my dreams meaning? \nAny insight is appreciated!"

I think I was a child again because I was sitting on my bed next to the door with 6-7 other kids who fit on the bed with legroom to spare. I didn‚Äôt recognize anyone in the dream from real life besides a girl from my school (let‚Äôs call her Emma) and one of my friends irl. Across the room from us next to the window where my desk is was a man who I can‚Äôt really describe what he looked like besides he had a charismatic aura &amp; long straight hair but he had one leg up so that his hand was resting on his knee and the other leg down relaxed. He would call up the kids in a girl-boy-girl-boy pattern and molest them there although the molestation in my dream was not explicit it was something of that nature going on. Once the kids went up to him I don‚Äôt know where they went they sort of just disappeared or I didn‚Äôt notice them in my dream, they didn‚Äôt go back to the bed but I only really watched a couple of kids going up.\n\nWhen he called your name it was like it was your nature to go up to him, you couldn‚Äôt do anything else. When there were only 3 of us left including me he called up this girl up. She stood up and she looked paralyzed with fear and she asked where Emma was, as if she was trying to distract him or make him pick her to go up instead. Emma madly yells ‚ÄúI AM HERE‚Äù in Spanish (although I think this is what she meant if I take my dream literally she actually had said ‚Äúyou are here‚Äù). At this point I realized my friend was gone or had left the room so I ran to my door and slammed it, afraid he was behind me and then I reopened the door because I felt bad for leaving the other girls in there but no one came out. I ran to another place in my home and found my friend curled up under a blanket next to a motionless body (suspect this was my brother or my dad) I didn‚Äôt know it was her until i unfurled it and she was sobbing inside and I hugged her and started talking but at this point I woke up. \n\nI‚Äôm having trouble making sense of why I had this dream, can someone help me interpret this"

A year ago, i had three dreams with the same type of creature named \"the sentinels\", they walk in groups and they have appeared with different physical forms each time.\n\nI won't give much details to the dreams because i remember ALL of it and it would've been too long for me to post here.\n\nThe first dream i had, i was with a friend of mine walking through school and he was silent the whole time. I was the one talking and we both got to the school's courtyard, he saw two boys sat down and we talked to them, they seemed very friendly but after i introduced myself, they frowned, looking angry/shocked by my answer.\nMy friend grabbed me by my wrist and ran away, shouting \"we need to go!\" and as soon as we got to a safe place (close enough to the courtyard for us to see) i saw a hole in the sky, where the sentinels came from.\n\nThey had unrecognizable faces and bodies, but they all had the colour green on them (one of my favorite colors) and they wouldn't stop coming from what looked like a escalator. \n\nAfter that, they appeared twice in my dreams with two different forms: the first one being more human-like, being extremely tall, covered in black bandages with big noses and long chins; the second they were looking like black polygonal dolls with white oval eyes and stars on their bodies.\n\nIn every dream, they chased me and i've never understood why.

    "body": "I've got some time to spare so I wanted to share some tips I have about dreams and how to interpret them. \nHi, I'm a dream interpreter and a taulasea. My practice revolves around keeping the spirit healthy and balanced.\n\nWhen I give a reading I'm not just going off of a dream but I'm interpreting the person communicating their dream to me so instead of focusing on symbols and meanings I want to talk about langaue.\n\nThere are many ways to say one thing, one thing has many ways of being said, you can say one thing in many different ways - you get the idea. \n\nWe can all relate to the fuzzy and confused feeling we experience waking from an especially weird dream so we can all agree that during this confusion haze remembering details is sometimes difficult and communicating those details/ finding ways to describe what only our eyes understand is probably a hard ask. So when we try to describe what our dream consisted of, we find ourselves over explaining details and underexplaining others. \n\nEg: \"I woke up in a library with rows and rows of books, they were blue and yellow, pink and purple. I was there with this girl I knew once\" \n\nThese pockets help us look into a person's psyche and observe what free open information the dreamer is willing to give you and what bits of information are off limits and therefore unavailable to used in a descriptive matter towards the interpreter.\nWe can combat this by looking for illogicality or an outright lack of information, especially in the missing or short details. \n\nIn the example of the two sentences I provided previously, the dreamer gives the description \n\"I was there with this girl, I knew her once.\" \nhowever to say the corrected version of this sentence in a normal conversation would sound more like \"I was there with a girl I once knew\". Now this lack of information has given us a lineage of thought from the way it was communicated by the dreamer. Comparing the corrected version to the original, we can also observe the added \"this\" that was replaced with \"a\" that the dreamer has added in the original is not meant to be in that sentence so we now have cause and reason to ask why \"this\" girl. \n\nDreams aren't just pictures that you see when you close your eyes, dreams are you brain talking to your subconscious visually. When things talk, they need language and if there is language there's something to listen to. \n\nThanks for reading I hope this helps, sorry for the format I'm on my phone."

Funny enough I felt time slow down, aiming the gun felt like it took forever, on top of that I had to take the safety off the gun.

Have you ever had a dream where you woke up only to feel like this corporeal realm was the dream?\n\nIn one of those dreams I was messing around the world like I usually do, running fast jumping high etc. That‚Äôs when it felt like someone invaded my dream, or at least was just as conscious if not more so. He was best described as a tall pale elf with a nice suit on. He pointed out that I had morphed my legs, surely enough when I looked down my right leg had morphed and evolved. There was even a him of fascination in his voice and facial expression, like he was genuinely impressed. \n\n‚Ä¢ There have been other dreams when I clearly have failed test or others are quite obviously disappointed with my actions. \n\nWhen I was younger I even had an occurrence where I had a lucid dream.

So it all started that I was rushing to save the 9 cats before the monster gets up. It was bright afternoon when I started to take the cats from the nest of the monster which is in the light house. Before 6PM all cats should be out from that dark monster's nest then when I'm about to take the last cat, I was figuring out on how to get off on the wall and step into a big boulder on the lower level of the lighthouse and I'm hearing that someone is telling me to be cautious of jumping on that boulder because there's a possibility that I could slip and drown in the ocean. Idk how did I get in on that lighthouse and the monster woke up, I called him slenderman even though he doesn't look exactly like slenderman maybe I'm referring to call him boogeyman. When I feel that he's going to get closer to me, I pretended that I'm already dead and I feel like someone is pulling me from my back and I was assuming that he's the one who's pulling my clothes from my back and he dumped me somewhere dark.\n\nIdk what it means, cs' I just barely dream about such things and I feel like it's too realistic.

    "body": "I‚Äôm new here! Looking for any and all interpretations of this dream I had this morning.\n\nThe dream started mid-conversation in the hallway of an office building. I was with a small group of friends, maybe 4 or 5 of them, although I don‚Äôt remember who they were specifically. We were walking through this hallway with a janitor of the building, and he eventually led us to a door. He opened the door for us and we entered what appeared to be a clubhouse of sorts. It looked like an entire floor of the office building had been gutted and was being used by a gang or some group of people as a hideout - dirty couches, tables with stuff all over them, shelves full of clothing and personal items, etc. The place wasn‚Äôt filthy but it was certainly lived in. The janitor showed us in and then left. It felt like he was providing us shelter or a respite from something, although there was never discussion of us being outlaws or homeless or anything like that. \n\nMy friends and I began resting, treating the space like our own. We took our shoes off and ruffled through the items that were strewn about and talked to each other. I cannot remember what we talked about but I never got the feeling that we were in trouble or that we shouldn‚Äôt be there. After all, a kind janitor had showed us the way here and while the place seemed like people lived there, I think our impression was that it had been abandoned. \n\nAfter a while I laid down on a couch and dozed off‚Ä¶and was shaken violently awake by a deranged man whose face was nearly touching my own. I could see that he had arrived with others, who were grappling with and roughing up my friends in similar fashion. He demanded to know why we were there, and I frantically told him about the janitor who had brought us there. He paid that answer no mind at all, and he either pressed a knife to my genitals or grabbed them through my jeans, I couldn‚Äôt tell. It didn‚Äôt hurt but it was uncomfortable and terrifying. He threatened violence if I didn‚Äôt tell him the truth. I don‚Äôt remember if he gave specifics on what he‚Äôd do but I feared for my life and the lives of my friends. I repeated the janitor story and he kept threatening me, and this went on for some time until finally he sort of deflated and told us to just leave. It seemed almost like he was disappointed that we weren‚Äôt there with some insidious agenda to thwart or harm him and his companions. He told us to grab our things and get out, and my friends quickly did so. However, I couldn‚Äôt find my shoes. I frantically searched all over the room but they were nowhere to be found. He and his companions watched me closely the whole time, which made me even more nervous and frantic. Eventually he got agitated again and began shouting at me to just get my things and leave. He grew angrier and angrier until I just gave up and walked towards the exit without my shoes. As I approached the exit, I woke up."

We did become separated a few times but the overall emotion was calm and curious. \n\nThen it switched and we were in a marshland with a walking path. I noticed two snakes in the water.

Then this narrator voice told me to leave in a few minutes, but I realized I was covered in mud. So I went to this shower room, and my boyfriend showed up and asked if he could shower with me. He was also dirty but without any mud, which was weird. After we were done, I put my muddy phone on the window sill and forgot all about it.\n\nWe walked outside into the neighborhood, and all of a sudden, I remembered my phone. We ended up at a half-wall loaded with flowers in red, purple, and yellow. I climbed up, saw two little cacti, and kicked them off the ledge so I could walk across.\n\n My boyfriend and I talked about something that had to do with shoegaze. However, as we tried to re-enter the house, we were too scared to go inside. My boyfriend eventually hyped himself up and claimed that he wasn't afraid of whoever or whatever was inside the house. As we attempted to cross the street, a ton of cars passed by, and one of them swerved into the house. The driver was angry and said something that mentioned the scary thing inside the house. My boyfriend and I couldn't help but feel like this wasn't a coincidence.\n\nFinally, we made it to the door of the house, and I knocked, peeking through the window. When I opened the door a little bit, I saw my boyfriend setting up a table for his birthday. However, as I turned around, the real boyfriend was standing behind me, spooked and trying to hide from the imposter. The imposter suddenly opened their mouth super wide, and their whole face turned black, which terrified me. I quickly closed the door, thinking I had woken up. I turned around to try and wake up my boyfriend to see if it was him, and I asked him to shoegaze me (which I think meant to see in the dream). However, I realized that I was still sleeping, and my boyfriend suddenly woke up. His eyes and mouth opened wide and turned pitch black, and he started laughing at me,"

I‚Äôm on the bed I look down at my body and I‚Äôm pregnant also ready to push. I noticed the nurses were busy with the other women. Instead of bothering the nurses I delivered my own baby by getting off the bed, walking into a corner of the room then i squatted down to push. The baby comes out I see he‚Äôs a boy and I cut the umbilical cord with a string. I mustard up all the strength I had to walk to a nurse and ask for help. \nThe nurse puts me in a new room and bed with my baby. The room is dimly light. I take my phone out to take a couple pictures of the baby and I keep the flash on to make sure I can see my baby latching and drinking milk. \nI look around the room and there‚Äôs another bed and my ex is lying down. I let my baby finish feeding then get up to tell him this is his baby and he‚Äôs going to take care of it. \nHe immediately tells me that‚Äôs not his baby and we broke up. For some reason I know exactly what happened prior (in reality this is not true) I tell him that I didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant for 8 months and we only broke up a month ago.. \nOnce I say that he reluctantly takes the baby. I don‚Äôt have a name yet. Memories of the situation are coming to me and I genuinely didn‚Äôt know I was pregnant until that moment I came to the hospital. \nWe leave the hospital together and instead of having a conversation face to face he‚Äôs talking to me out loud and my response is being written on the walls like graffiti. Everything I wanted to say and my response to him is like magically being wrote out letter by letter in handwriting. \nIt didn‚Äôt feel like we came to any conclusions or solution.

    "body": "Okay, I'm going to do the best I can to describe what happened in this very strange and upsetting dream.  Im going to provide all of the weird details and name a few random celebrities and influencers (some of whom I don't know or follow, I just know their names) who appeared in the dream.\n\nBack in July, I was laid off from my corporate job and I began working at a Montessori school with toddlers. When last nights dream began, I was standing in what appeared to be my old office and there was an extremely young (around 17y/o) feminine presenting, non-binary, C-suite person who gave me a letter offering my corporate job back with a raise. I told them I was eager to accept, and I just needed to wait  until the school year was over. \n\nSo, Im walking around the office noticing all of the changes and somehow my old office and school campus merge into one. I keep seeing that person who offered me a job on campus/in the office and each time I saw them I would try to say something friendly or complementary to them, but they had an issue with everything I said. Well, they called me out after most things I said. While in the dream, I realized they were kind of showing me how I was \"doing too much\" in my conversation just because I was talking to a non-binary person. The best way I can describe it is like when a black american (im a black american) is talking to a white person and they keep randomly  saying things like \"I voted for Obama twice\" or \"my best friend is black\" in the conversation and it's cringy. Idk if this part of the dream is important, but I just remember being frustrated that this 17y/o was seemingly giving me so much crap. And I really wanted my corporate job back because I would be making significantly more money again.\n\n\nI get in my car to drive home and this is where the action really begins. Im driving on the highway, and as  I'm looking through my windshield, I think about James Charles, a young Influencer in Make Up, and The Paul Brothers (Jake and the other one) and through my windshield is like a TV set and I see these people as if Im watching them on a sitcom. And I guess I'm sort of transported onto the set, and when I turn to face where the camera and live audience are sitting, I'm back in my car and I'm driving against traffic on the street, but there are barely any cars on the the road at all. But this happens a few times, I straighten myself out, end up back on set and end up turned around on the road again.\n\nSo I pull off of the road and I go into this house where James and Jake actually are, and Madison Beer for some reason. I tell them what's happening and they looked very concerned. I make a phone call to who I think is my real life husband, but it's actually to the morning radio show \"the breakfast club\". I hang up and call my husband and he's like \"I was wondering where you were, it's been so long since you got off of work and I'm kind of annoyed you're not here.\" In real life, he's not like that at all and would have come and picked me up immediately. \n\nSo, I'm really ready to get home at this point. So I go back out to the car and my HR person from my current job, Brittney, offers to follow behind me in her car to make sure I get home safely. Then, mine and my husbands married friends Wallace and Allison appear and Allison offers to drive me home in my car. Her husband says to us before we take off \"Just remember I need my wife and mother of my child back, so drive safe.\" I am 16 weeks pregnant in real life, too, if that adds anything. I think I'm pregnant in the dream as well. I'm also not close to this couple, they are really good acquaintances. But I am always pleasantly enthused by Allisons kindness in real life. We just don't see or speak to them often.\n\nOk, almost to the end.\n\nSo we get on the road, and I guess there was a GPS involved, because we kept having to go through these residential neighborhoods. And as we drive through each one, they are larger and larger neighborhoods and they become more and more decorated with blow ups and string lights, I don't know what was being celebrated. There weren't any scary decorations, but it kept growing darker outside and more ominous as we drove on. There were also tons of people outside of their homes and in the street, and we kept having to drive slower and slower. At one point, I see Brittney running in the semi dark toward our car, and she passes by a man who looks like Andy Dick, and when she passes him he starts runnimg towards the car too. I grab Brittney through the passenger window and pull her into the car with us. And Andy is holding a broken perfume bottle and says \"Hey! Do you want your nebulizer?\" I say no and drive off. \n\nThen, I get a call on my phone from Brittney, and I notice she's not in the car. I answered the phone and said \"Hey, where are you?\" And she says \"I'm in new York. This isn't going to happen.\" Then we hang up, but I have this understanding. Im just happy she was able to make it out of the labyrinth. \n\nI also make music, so I see I have a missed call from Rapper Pusha T on my phone,  and I'm in shock and listen to the message. He goes \"Hey, it's Pusha. I just wanted to call and say I love your music, and I would love to talk to you because I think you're so funny!\" And I tell Allison who is still driving through all of this, and she says that's great. Then my phone turned into like a brillo pad. We are still driving through decorated and crowded middle class suburban neighborhoods and at this point we are moving at a snails pace. Our lights were shinning im peoples and no one is upset with us, but there is no urgency to get out of the way of a moving vehicle. \n\nWe are now at the end of the dream, and our car ends up inside a house with a party going on, bustling with people. And Allison points out Pusha T, and I can't really remember what he said anymore, but he calls us crazy and I'm finally able to wake myself up, telling my husband who is already awake about the dream. I googled the meaning of \"driving through a crowd of people\" and the website dream encyclopedia said the following:\n\nDream about Driving A Car Through A Crowd is a harbinger for your drive, determination and ambition. You feel that people are talking about you behind your back. You are feeling apprehensive about something. This dream points at a blossoming relationship. You will life's difficulties.\n\nI woke up very uncomfortable and sad, and only now after writing it all out do I feel any better. Anyway, I am hoping someone can tell me what they think about this bizarre dream. If you made it all the way to the end, I thank you."

I‚Äôm staying in.‚Äù\n\nhe got frustrated with me insisting he gets out of the coffin, and then two women came by his side, seran wrapped his arms and legs to his sides (in the dream i interpreted this as a way to prevent him from moving, since he was ‚Äúsupposed to be‚Äù dead?) \n\nThen I woke up and texted him, told him I had the craziest,\nmost morbid dream about him‚Ä¶\nIt did not deliver. \n\n8 hours after I texted him I decided to add his friend on instagram to see if i could see if he was okay. He is an addict, and I got worried after the dream and no delivered text. \n\nHis friend added me back and immediately messaged me and asked me if I knew what was going on, I said no, \n\nThis is when he told me that My friend frankie had been in a coma for 3 days on full life support after a relapse. He had a 20% chance of waking up and being coherent (not being a vegetable). \n\n\nOne week later he woke up and beat the odds, he is still here on earth and doing fine as far as I know. \n\n\nI‚Äôve asked mediums about this and they told me that it means his spirit was contacting me. \n\nI asked another spiritual person who said this must mean we have a deep connection to have communicated in this way.\n\n\nI‚Äôve also been told my another medium that I am ‚Äúvery visual‚Äù.. not sure what that means.\n\nFrank is the type of guy who would say something like that if he could speak in a coma as well.. he once told me that the other time he overdosed and died for a few minutes before being revived, it was ‚Äúthe most peace he‚Äôd ever felt‚Äù.. \n\nThis was quite surreal for me as you could imagine because it can‚Äôt really be explained scientifically.. I‚Äôm just wondering if this says anything about me, or what your theories are on what this could mean in regards to an explanation.. this was quite a spiritual experience in my opinion \n\nLet me know if you have any knowledge on this or similar experiences. thanks"

    "body": "I lost my dog in August 2022. A white cat kept visiting my neighborhood. This is going to be important in the story.\n\nThe loss of my late dog was extremely tough for me, because he has been my best friend of 13 years, and I couldn‚Äôt stop crying on the day he passed. I felt extremely unmotivated to do anything for at least a week. My grief was definitely hard, but it was healthy. There were so many times he would visit me in my dreams, and it happens at least two times a month. It always warms my heart to see that he is in a better place at least.\n\nNow in September, when my boyfriend was visiting me, we both saw a small white kitten who looked like he was starving. At first we didn‚Äôt want to impose, but the cat‚Äôs cute brown and blue eyes (he has heterochromia) were too hard to resist. He eventually warmed up to us and became our new friend.\n\nI didn‚Äôt get to see the cat until two months later, but he was all grown up and a lot fluffier now. We recognized each other instantly and he would always adore my pets. Now moving on to the point of the situation.\n\nWhen I would sleep, sometimes I see my dog looking at me, and he would sometimes give me cuddles for some comfort if I am at my worst moments. I struggle with social anxiety, so I see animals as comfort to me. The white cat actually jumped on my bedroom window one night and I find it adorable! When I told my friends about it on Discord, one of them (who is Buddhist) made a theory that the white cat could actually be a reincarnation of my late dog.\n\nHonestly if this is the case, I am willing to believe it. The energy feels so real and the cat has filled a hole in my heart that was too tender for me. The connection helped me move on, and I feel I have a new best friend, but I will never forget the memories I had with my dog. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

    "body": "Hi! First (and hopefully only) post, I had a run of dreams in which I didn't get scared, but I did feel sad, uncomfortable or angry, without being lucid dreams or, I think, nightmares.\nI'm going to write from the softest to the most uncomfortable, putting the order at the beginning\n\n(3) I was preparing lunch for my brother, something quite common since he is the favorite, but while the food was in the oven I went to see him in his room, when I entered I crashed face to face with a cloud of fruit flies, his room infested, and he was very quiet on his computer. As I am very disgusted by insects I asked whoever to do something about it, but nobody cared, in fact, they said I was making a drama.\n\n(4) I found myself in a fair, one of those linear ones where they sell vegetables, fruit, eggs, handcrafted articles, kitchen trinkets or toys, fake jewelry and makeup, it seemed eternal, or rather, a loop, as a person sensitive to light and not very tolerant to noise and smells, I was overwhelmed. I arrived at a point where they only sold jewelry, there was abrupt silence, and I felt hypnotized with a pair of black earrings, with a chain and at the end of it a small cross, when I paid for them and put them on, I woke up (today I'm still looking for them, I need to have them).\n\n(2) There were two unknown cats in my yard, who had entered through a hole someone or something had made in the wall. The larger one, a little bigger than a modern microwave, very thick white fur, and honestly very ugly looking, and a cat smaller than a pigeon, black short hair, angry. I opened the door for them and they didn't leave, I ran them around the yard with a broom, and they didn't leave, I aimed the water from the hose straight at them until they were soaked, they never left. I sat on the wet ground, felt my heart racing and woke up.\n\n(5) I had moved to the coast with my family, and we had started raising a bunch of, I don't know, chicks, ducklings or something like that, no bigger than a disposable lighter, in between my mom was obsessed with me fixing a broken teddy bear she found in the crawl space of the old house, at one point some huge dogs came in from the street, they destroyed the pens in the backyard, I couldn't save them all, not to say they were all seriously injured, I didn't end up with more than a dozen birds, out of the more than 600 that were there.\n\n(1) I woke up in the morning(supposedly), went to put on socks because I was extremely cold, and when I looked at the soles of my feet I had, if not spots, pockets of blood under the skin, all my veins popped, I felt like I didn't care enough, but I was afraid of stepping on, popping and staining the floor, when I tell my grandmother (her bed is next to mine) she says she doesn't care, I get anxious because I don't want to stay in bed, but I can't get out of bed either, crawling is not an option because my room is a storage room, so it's crowded. \n\nSorry if you don't understand, I used a translator, there are not many active subreddits about dream meanings in Spanish."

    "body": "This was my first lucid dream experience since reading ‚ÄúExploring the World of Lucid Dreaming.‚Äù I‚Äôve lucid dreamed before, but only took a serious interest in it earlier this year. So I recently read the first half of ‚ÄúExploring the World of Lucid Dreaming‚Äù and had my first experience this morning. \n\nMy dog woke me up at 6:30am and we went for a walk. I went back to bed about an hour later. From around 7:30-10:00am. \n\nMY DREAM (or at least the most relevant part)‚Ä¶\n\nI‚Äôm in the city walking around with my fianc√©, his mom, and sister (they recently visited and so this wasn‚Äôt that unusual). However, I start to feel faint and lightheaded. I tell my fianc√©. He holds onto my arm as I fall gently to the pavement. I‚Äôm in the fetal position on the cement. As I go unconscious, I can hear them around me and other people rushing over to help. \n\nI wake up (STILL DREAMING though. This is still part of the dream). I‚Äôm in a basement. In a house. It‚Äôs styled very 70‚Äôs. It‚Äôs dimly lit. I go upstairs, look around, call out their names. No one is there. I‚Äôm alone. It‚Äôs night. I assume they brought me back to what I assume at the time is a short-term rental or something and left me to recuperate from heat exhaustion or whatever caused me to pass out. I go back in basement. Something follows me. I see it out of the corner of my eyes at first. It‚Äôs coming down the stairs and scurrying like an animal. When I glance back at it again again though it‚Äôs now in the basement and seems more like a slither. A big snake. Like a giant anaconda. Striped yellow and black. It‚Äôs in the adjoining room. Moving back and forth in repetitive motions. Like moving in an S shape back and forth. I can‚Äôt tell if it knows I‚Äôm there or not but I don‚Äôt want to look at it directly because it‚Äôs scaring me. I try to escape and none of the windows open. That‚Äôs when I realize I‚Äôm in a bad dream and wake up. \n\nI‚Äôm ACTUALLY AWAKE this time, but my eyes are still closed. I realize that I don‚Äôt have to go to work today (it‚Äôs Sunday) and the dog has already been walked. The dream hasn‚Äôt slipped too far away yet and so I decide to ‚Äúgo back in‚Äù and try to lucid dream. I‚Äôm sure that if it‚Äôs my dream that I can find a way out of the basement. \n\nSo I keep my eyes closed, and concentrate on the last things I remember. The shapes, the colors, and slowing things go from empty blackness back to life. I‚Äôm back in the dream and literally right where I left. But this time I‚Äôm very aware of what‚Äôs happening. I‚Äôm so intrigued by how real everything looks and feels. But I remember why I‚Äôm there and start to looked for a way out again. There are a few rectangular basement windows and one won‚Äôt unlock, the other I‚Äôm too big to squeeze through, and then finally the last one I can climb out of.\n\n(Side Note): before I exit the house, since I‚Äôm aware of what is happening, I try to channel some of the skills referred to in Stephen Laberge‚Äôs book. I try to soak in all of the details. And looks for some ‚Äúdream signs.‚Äù I immediately sense that this is a house that I‚Äôve been in before. Not in real life. But a dream house. At least a few times, maybe many. It‚Äôs familiar and I can almost recall other dreams here. I note the shape of the latch on the window, the shape and color of the tile floor, the walls, the shape of the room, the stairs to the basement, etc so that I can write it down in waking like and remember it for later in case I‚Äôm here again. \n\nOk so back to the dream ‚Ä¶ I get out of the window. I walk out to the street and look back at the house. I want to remember all of the details. It‚Äôs a ranch house. Brick. There‚Äôs a driveway on the right hand side and a garage, hedges on the left. There‚Äôs some ironwork on the right hand side..maybe exterior stairs. I keep repeating these things to myself until I finally tell myself I can wake up now to write all of it down. \n\nThis is where it gets weird.\n\nI don‚Äôt know what compelled me to, but I ask my mom later that day if she ever lived in a ranch house. She said yes. The first house she grew up in when she was a child. Maybe until 10 years old. I describe to her everything I saw and ask her if it was like that. She can‚Äôt really remember but says she‚Äôll look for photos. She gives me the address, we look it up Zillow together and jaws drop because it looks like the same house. At least the exterior. I‚Äôm still waiting on the photos to compare the interior because it‚Äôs been renovated since. \n\nCan anyone interpret any aspect of the dream itself? And does this seem to have any significance as my first ‚Äúreal‚Äù lucid dream? A very strange experience for my first time with the intention to actually notice my surroundings."

I was 19 weeks pregnant and just about to find out the gender of my baby. Everything was normal and exact to life. I was in my home with my partner and our two children. The only difference was that my late mother was still living with us. My partner and I were discussing the baby, how I felt this one was a girl, and decided to use a Doppler to listen to the heartbeat. Afterwards walking in the house I felt some liquid come out and realized I had light bleeding. I went to the bathroom to sit on the toilet where more blood came out and I saw the legs of the fetus sticking out of me. It was even true to size of what would be at 19 weeks. I thought to myself this can't be happening and was so sad. I passed the whole fetus and then told my partner and mother. My mother watched the children while my partner took me to the hospital. It felt real. Usually in dreams there is something off about the environment or how things are handled but not this. It was like a memory of sorts and I dreamt in first person. I'm having trouble trying to figure out what this could even potentially mean."

Heading home, at first I had it just walking beside me - we turned onto a long road and as we did, it got dark like night time, and it started pouring rain (and I didn't have an umbrella or poncho or anything).  The road was not paved so it got really muddy and walking down it became very difficult.  Then a bunch of cars started coming down the road in the opposite direction - I was motioning to them to be careful of the pig, until one of them was forced to stop, and the pig climbed up into the engine.  Thankfully the driver got out and opened the hood, so I called to the pig and it came out and I was able to grab it.  So I continued down the muddy road, drenched and having a hard time seeing in the dark, carrying my stuff plus this pig.  But I kept going knowing that eventually I would make it to the end and then make it home - I just had to make sure I held onto this pig until then.

I always have lucid, and clear dreams but they aren't always nightmares consecutively. \n\nMy dreams lately have been.\n\nThanks in advance!"

    "body": "Hi, Im just a person not really understanding myself. I feel like dreams really do have a true meaning. Anyways, Im in middle school &amp; dealing with social anxiety I got no one but want people. Im really lonely its just me and my thoughts. So i think yesterday I had a dream that I saw my youngerself I was in a type of a school gym there would people spread around, not that much like 20, doing their own stuff. Then I just saw my younger self next to me, there was a mirror right beside me. I hugged my youngerself and cried and sobbed I felt like i missed that little girl very much. I saw the mirror, I looked really short for some reason. I looked like I was 7 and my younger self was 3. But the song 'thank u next' started playing i dont know why I think it made me cry more. But about 2 weeks ago before this dream I went on a trip and when I was coming back with my family, the song 'thank u next' played it was late at night like 11:30. I dont know what this dream means. Im just trying to figure out myself. Thank you."

    "body": "[I woke up from this 5 minutes ago] it started at a beach, there were a lot of people from my school there. we were all doing things like looking for rocks and shells, I found some really nice shells and went to sit down with a couple of other girls. Once I sat down this girl said something about a strange noise underground, a split second after I heard it and joked about it to a classmate. About 3 seconds later the earth split between me and the other people, only about a foot wide and not very long though. this voice came over like a loudspeaker about how this is an emergency and the kill will begin soon. we end up at my school, outside everyone is rushing in. once i get in i am planning with one of my classmates, i tell her i‚Äôm going commit suicide. the teachers call over the loudspeaker to stay on the field as it‚Äôs the safest, i hear someone yell that it‚Äôs a trap. after we hear of more zombies being spotted i run up to a classroom that has a small med bay attached, i grab out a box of many pills and start begging to my teacher (he‚Äôs a teacher i actually know irl) whilst im shaking and sobbing to tell me which ones will kill me, I hold up some long white pills and he tells me they won‚Äôt do much, I still shovel a handful into my mouth, I hold up a container of red pills and he says they won‚Äôt kill me, I still swallow a few. this is soon interrupted by a zombie coming up the stairwell, i and a lot of other students run down the stairwell behind it to another class to try hide again. i hug this random guy my age and tell him i will see him in another life and that i need a hug before i go. (that really creeped me out) our hiding place is soon found and everyone flees from the zombie that had just entered the room, as we are all running down the stairs the zombie began to speak and throw taunting insults at us. the dream ended when i got outside."

I went to dream dictionary but it was relatively useless.\n\nWe received a notice from the city that our house would have to be demolished for part of a tunnel system (she couldn't remember what the tunnels were for) and that we had to be moved out.by a certain date(doesn't remember the date). She got into an argument not wanting to move out because of the work we put into our house. They said they had temporary shelter for us and would buy us a house of equal value.\n\nAfter they left we were now at a party with her family in Nebraska, she said there were several people there our age she didn't recognize. We were at one of her uncle's houses(however this uncle does not live in Nebraska). She showed the notice to her parents who were upset with her. Then one of her aunts came up, saw the note and said they were doing similar tunnels around Omaha."

    "body": "I have recently been plagued with nightmares about my brothers, both of whom have passed. \n\nFor context, my older brother passed away ten years ago. He died by suicide at 29. My younger brother was an addict, and his addiction took him at 34, just this past December. \n\nSince my younger brother passed, I have had recurring dreams. They aren‚Äôt always exactly the same. Some are lucid, some are not, and there‚Äôs always a different setting. \n\nIt essentially all comes down to me trying to accomplish some sort of task. They are always both there, but bandaged and unhealthy. They‚Äôre helping me accomplish whatever weird dream task is assigned, but they keep dying again and I have to fix bandages or call 911 to revive them. Then they‚Äôre back, and back to helping me again. \n\nI remember the dreams sometimes, and sometimes it‚Äôs only these vague images, but I know it‚Äôs happened again because I wake up with my pillow just drenched in tears. \n\nI can‚Äôt understand what any of it means. Especially how graphic it sometimes is with them dying and me fixing them and bringing them back. It‚Äôs always gross and I always feel this immense pressure is on me to to save them. \n\nI have a few theories, but I‚Äôd desperately like some input. I‚Äôm hoping that if I can understand the message, the dreams will stop and I can sleep peacefully again."

    "body": "I was at a party somewhere and decided to take a break. I wandered to a small cafeteria near the edge of the party. For some reason, John Carpenter, renowned film director, was working there behind the counter and we started talking. I ordered a slice of cheesecake from him because something about it seemed important.\n\nThe next thing I knew, John and I were in a taxi heading somewhere. It was dark, lit only by the orange streetlights and the lights inside the taxi. As we talked, I didn‚Äôt even care where we were going, I just had a sense that John Carpenter‚Äôs time was valuable and I was lucky to be talking to him. I told him about my troubles, hoping for some advice from an older man who‚Äôd become successful himself. He simply nodded sagely, indicating that he‚Äôd gone through much the same things as I had. It was comforting to know that John Carpenter had faced the same things I was facing and succeeded. Perhaps that was all I wanted to know.\n\nAs he continued to talk, John Carpenter ran a pencil down my back, digging into my flesh. It wasn‚Äôt enough to seriously hurt me, but it was painful. Thinking that he was imparting some lesson, I braved the pain and withstood it until he was done with the pencil. I felt proud of myself.\n\nI woke up. It was only afterwards I realized that I‚Äôd been so focused on the pain of the pencil that I hadn‚Äôt heard what John Carpenter said!"

    "body": "So, I‚Äôm just gonna jump in, me and the guy i was with for over a year have just recently broken up. It was toxic. However, any time that we break up I can hear and see things in my dreams that involve him or his friends. For example, when we broke up over the winter, I had a dream that he had a new girlfriend or sneaky link. Whatever you wanna call it and lo and behold when we got back together, he had told me how he met another girl and that they didn‚Äôt work well together so they only lasted about two weeks. He told me not to be mad and I told him I couldn‚Äôt be mad because I already knew obviously he didn‚Äôt understand. We got back together. Everything was good now we‚Äôre not together and I just woke up from a dream where I heard his two friends talking about him and this other woman. (now for context, he‚Äôs in the Navy and him, and a friend of his got married to get the BAH checks) the girls name is sierra btw‚Ä¶..him, and I were going to get married, but long story short, it would‚Äôve been a terrible situation. Now back to this dream. Right before I woke up, I was standing behind a corner, and I could hear his best friend and his cousin having a conversation about him. Lets call them k and t.\nSo T goes ‚Äúwhat u think about that shit wit will and sierra?‚Äù K responds ‚Äúhonestly at first I thought it was nothing but the way hes been treating d( d is me) is fucked up and makes me question him and sierras relationship.‚Äù T follows up with ‚Äú i wouldnt be surprised if they were secretly together‚Äù. Now heres the weird part. K goes ‚Äú i would bet that they (will and sierra) either f*** in the car or they‚Äôre ‚Äòzarking‚Äô ‚Äú. And I immediately woke up. \nSo after freaking out abt what i heard i look up the word zarking‚Ä¶. Coined in 1978  zarking is an adjective and was a slang term for the word f***ing. Weird right? Ive never heard that word. Not on tv, or radio, and anyone in my family that would‚Äôve been around during that time has been long gone before i was born. I say all that to say why would this word be used and I‚Äôve never known it to be a word???? I often have dreams that give me symbolism or a clue in life. But im stumped."

    "body": "Hello! I just came across this community because I was searching for the right place to post this. Feel free to take this down if not appropriate.\n\nOkay so, this dream happened maybe two years or so ago, and I've thought on it many times over the time period after this dream. As my memory isn't as great as it used to be, I'll try to describe it in the best detail I can remember. Now the more I learn about occultism and symbology, deities/spirits, and shadow work/meditation/internal reflection, the more of a solid idea I have of who these characters may be. \n\nSo this dream (I can't clearly remember how it started) took place in what felt like a temple, but looked like a tunnel of sorts? Like a corridor. Different rooms were accessible but never entered. There were three women, at first. I don't clearly remember any conversation that I had with said women. However I felt a very negative energy when interacting with them. They were \"guiding\" me through this corridor, showing me different things, and there was a particular room, that looked like a dedicated space to someone (possibly a deity). Felt very sacred. However I can't remember if I was told who this space was for. \n\nNow after I left this room/space, I traveled back through the corridor, making back to my original position. And as the three women approached me, the closer they got, the more of a feeling of dread/fear I felt. Then, when they reach a close distance from me, Im talking maybe 6 or more feet, I instantly started to fall. What looked like a massive hole, with beings reaching out to grab me, to pull me farther and farther into the depths, I called out for help, for someone to save me from this fall. I remember speaking a name of someone, but for the life of me I can't remember who I called for. But I remember very clearly, a woman reaching down to me, with an outstretched hand, took my hand and pulled me back to the \"surface\". \n\nI don't remember what she looked like, or what her name was, but the connection I felt to her was immaculate. Comfortable, and familiar. The three women from before seemed irritated with this woman, as if she ruined their plan or something, and then they disappeared, not suddenly, but gradually. As if fading from sight. At the end of the dream (after this woman saved me) I remember crying to her and thanking her. And for some reason, I have a vague recollection of an embrace. But Im not sure if this is from this dream or another. And then the dream ended, I woke up, and felt a sense of safety. \n\nNow for a little background, I feel a connection to the moon and the goddess Selene. Other deities that I'm contemplating working with is Lilith, Hecate, Hades, Lucifer, and other entities. If anyone could provide their interpretation of this dream it would be very much appreciated. Thank you in advance, and may peace find you all."

    "body": "I was with two other girls. I was younger in the dream. We were in the back room of some sort at a church. I was trying to lift a banner over candles that were lit up. One side caught fire but one of the girls put it out. The damage receded somewhat. While people were talking about repair of it, I noticed metal things stacked on top of each other. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone told me to call someone about it. I was scolded and I called and then the same person who told me to call was like don't ask to pay or don't listen when they ask to pay. (I can't remember.) confused and were like she (I) didn't ask to pay. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, apparently this whole thing was newsworthy because I was then running to hide in a big bathroom with the girls I mentioned in the beginning. We seemed younger maybe? I don't know. There were higher windows above us and we noticed the press coming close. I saw some of their shoes. I was concerned they would notice our feet from the stalls. (Apparently this is just an American thing but yeah our bathroom stall doors don't go all the way to the floor if I'm right in that it is only in our country.) We went out of the stalls and there were church goers in a what looked like a bus but I'm not sure, and they promised they wouldn't say we were here. So did a little girl. But since she was so young, she was naive and talked to the press. Then the dream ended."

The bird was STUCK head first in there, I realized with no sense of pain at all and pulled it out. He flew around frantically and tried to take out aggression on me like as if I did it on purpose. Still no sense of pain but my ear was bleeding very heavily. Blood was everywhere as I went to touch my ear for confirmation that it was in fact coming from my ear. It was all over the shoes fixtures. Etc. I dodged the bird and it flew away. I was worried about my hearing being lost because of this bird and then I woke up. I feel pretty drained from the dream."

He is me, but healthier and younger, we're the exact same age but he's a lot more good looking. I look like crap because of stress and work and got balding a bit, but he was completely healthy. \n\nI smiled back and tried to play it cool and asked my mom and my brother if they are seeing him too, but my mom and my brother looked at me stupidly, thinking as if they can't see him. They were like \"of course we can see him\" my mom and my brother thought he was a friend of mine who came to visit, and i was trying to make fun of him making him look like a ghost.\n\n\"No no no no\" i told them, i went closer to him and gently held his chin and touched my face close to him making us both look in one straight direction. \"Don't we look alike?! Mom?! What the heck is going on?! You need to explain\" Maybe my doppelganger was running late or something he wanted to leave the house, but i told him if we could be friends.

    "body": "This is the 2nd time I've had a dream of an adolescent white moose being followed by a large German shepherd looking black dog in 1 week.\n\nIn both dreams I was on a walk down the street towards my mom's house which I just moved out a few months ago. She lives in a wooded area, and I have walked this street many times and occasionally seen foxes, deer, turkeys, and other wildlife. I now live in a more suburban area, in my own house with my fianc√©, and our dog and cat. We are in the process of planning our wedding. For context, I am white, female, and 27 years old.\n\nIn both dreams I was accompanied by someone, but I dont remember if it was my mom or my fianc√©. It mightve changed part way through.\n\nThe first time I had this dream, the white moose is what caught my eye amongst the green trees. It is young, past the baby stage, but clearly not an adult. It was trotting parallel to the road across from where I stood on the street and I was awed by it. I had never seen an albino or leucistic animal in the wild. It made me think of the spirit bear, a leucistic variant of the black bear species. I noticed a black dog following it, trotting slightly behind but keeping pace. I have a German shepherd mix and it was much bigger than my dog and had slightly longer, coal black fur. But it was clearly a dog in my mind, not a wolf.\n\nAt first I was worried the moose was being chased but I didn't get the sense of danger and just watched them pass.\n\nThe second time I had this dream, I approached them. They had been walking this time and the moose stopped while the dog approached me. I was able to pet it and look at its collar for a name as I thought it might be lost. It was light brown and had a Wizarding world logo on it from Harry Potter but no tags. I thought the owner must be a harry potter fan like me and started calling the black dog Sirius.\n\nIt occurred to me that the white moose's name might be Prongs, but I didnt get the feeling that the names truly fit either animal. In the books, Prongs is a Stag, not a moose. They had a sense of awareness and intelligence about them.  But it didn't seem out of place at the moment until I looked back on it.\n\nThe dog gambled around me for a few minutes, and I laughed, playing with it as I do with my dog. Then it rejoined the moose and they started to walk away and I woke up. I wish I had been able to approach the moose as well.\n\nI tried to go back to sleep and rejoin the dream, but was not sucessful.\n\nIs this just my love of harry potter bleeding into my subconscious, or does it have a deeper meaning? I'm tempted to draw or paint what I saw. Any insight would be helpful. Thanks for reading, I know its a bit long."

At first it was joyous, lots of smiling, laughter then the vibe just‚Ä¶ shifted. It felt scary, oppressive, and really dark energy; the faces were no longer friendy but instead ominous and almost taunting. Is this a warning dream?

He had a white vest on him and a tattoo on his face. It was weird I knew he looked so different but when I looked into his eyes I knew it was him. We hugged and it‚Äôs hard to describe but I could actually feel him. \nThen came some sniper type gangsters and shot him and it was like loosing him all over again. Note. We absolutely had nothing to do with this type of life style. \nMy dad was a carpenter and before he died he was just setting up his own contracting business. \n\nI eventually found my mom in the small apartment and she was sitting on a couch in a black and white floral dress. I crawled up to her and lay on her chest cuddling her as I was in uncontrollably crying. I don‚Äôt think she said anything however , I remember saying I was overwhelmed but she I know she was comforting me. We shared a long hug and cuddle and again it was so real. I could feel the hug and my head lying in her chest. \n\nOne more veryyyy weird aspect. There was a middle aged woman who was suddenly in our company and this was my dads new GF. I was talking to her with such disgust and belittling anything she had to say.

So I'm thinking maybe thats where these dreams are coming from.\n\nSo the dreams themselves are always me late for classes in high school, specifically my senior year and they are always for different reasons, some times more tame sometimes a bit outlandish and kinda funny.\n\nSo here is a brief description of what I can remember  from 3 of them:\n\nThe first one I was in school and I wasnt late getting to school but then I would go to class and couldnt remember where things were or the school in my dreamsorld would have the classes be in different places then I remember them being so everytime I would go to a class it would change where the right class was. \n\nThe 2nd one was weirder it was like things were after an apocalypse because stuff was built from scrap metal and there were like robots, and the things making me late ranged as much as they possibly could, from like the school security mech protecting me, to the way to get to the classes being absolutely wild.\n\nThe 3rd one and I had secretly hoped that this one would be the end now that we are all packed and ready and there are 3 work days before we leave. \n\nBut I for some reason was in an escape room, and Jack Black was there, then I ended up in my friends house with his \"dad\" who definitely wasnt like thats not tea, thats the person in this dream kinda resembled Boogie2988, and I was like oh shoot we're late for class, and then as we walked out the door I recall being like wait a minute dude we graduated like a while ago.\n\nSo I just thought Id share these here and see what you all think."

I was concerned it was sick, so I kept trying to scare it off by charging and yelling, but it just continued to follow me. At one point it went down to a river beside the trail, it seemed to want to get in the water but couldn‚Äôt, and then it came running back up the trail toward me. It followed me all the way home, trying to leap onto me the whole time. It followed me into my house, and when I sat down jumped into my lap and sucked on my hair.

There was graffiti on a wall nearby and people were throwing Molotov cocktails at it and taking turns shooting at the building it was on and it just seemed like a fun past time or something. \n\nI remember having an intense feeling of doom  while watching my boyfriend shooting the gun at the wall and told someone I had felt that feeling all day. Then my vision went super weird as of blurry one second and then everything was double and lined with CMYK lines then iridescent then blurry again. I fell over and couldn‚Äôt speak or move for a few minutes and then was fine. I thought I had a seizure. After that I got up and continued just doing whatever. Talking, looking at things, etc. \n\nI then feel something land in my hair and brushed it out to see two moths connected/mating land on my foot. They were large and beautiful, like a combination of a rosy maple moth (pink and yellow coloring) but looked like Luna moths. They didn‚Äôt want to leave my body and wanted to stay on me it seemed, but I was edited out about insects sexing on me (lol) and was looking for something like a jar to put them in because I wanted to keep the male when it died after mating? My boyfriend was helping me look for a jar/container when a man from the party found a jar and put them in for me while I was saying ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt hurt them!‚Äù Once they were in the jar he handed it back to me and I remember the female moth peering out of the top and almost smiling/looking content or happy. So cute and fuzzy and chubby. \n\nI woke up after this. üòÖ"

    "body": "Hello! First time post, but this dream got me thinking. First, a little about myself that might be relevant. I am a 36 year old white male. I have a law degree, but am not a lawyer. I enjoy Jimmy Smits as an actor, but have not seen anything with him recently. I am single, and have been single for a long time. Here we go!  \n\n\nMy best friend (T), my girlfriend (again, no actual girlfriend), and myself, we all going to college. We are the same age as now, and this felt like we were a very tight knit friend group. I do not recognize the girlfriend in real life, but in this dream we have been dating for quite sometime. T goes off to his classes, and my girlfriend and I went to our class. We were taking a culinary arts program. She was excelling in the course, really applying herself; meanwhile I was slacking off and getting chastised by the instructor. But I didn't care because I have a law degree! This course would be fun, but I was not taking it too seriously. The instructor was Jimmy Smits, and he was an artsy snob that I did not like, and I did not care about his opinion. I do not remember what he said, probably because it was in one ear and out the other.\n\nI went to leave the class and I opened the door to see my girlfriend laying in a bed, belly down, naked. Jimmy Smits was laying naked, belly up. He was covered with a white sheet from the waist down, and I could see they were laying there but not doing anything. I got upset with the situation and told her that she had to leave and it we were done. I said \"Just get your stuff and leave by the time I get back.\" She argued, in a half hearted way, that she did not cheat on me, but they were just testing their wills against temptation since they were both attracted to one another. They wanted to see if they could lay naked but not do anything. I just kept repeating \"just leave before I get back\" and left. \n\nI met up with T upset, so we decided to go to a bar. Our mode of transportation was long boards, but they were half the size of actual long boards (I am not a skateboarded and never was). We started this trip in our hometown and had to cut through a neighborhood to get to the next city over. I remember going through this neighborhood and it feeling ominous. This neighborhood is familiar because it actually exists as a newer development, but it was more hilly in the dream, longer, and some of the house gave off vibes of danger and darkness. We looked at the homes as we passed, but did not stay long. There were not people out and about, and the nearby forest was closer to the roads than normal.\n\nWe finally got on a main road and were headed into town when we saw construction. But who cares! We are on long boards so we pressed through, weaving between bulldozers and cement trucks until we came to the unfinished edge of bridge. We stopped just before the edge and peered down a 40 - 50 foot drop. When I looked up, I saw the state capital in front of me (I live near the capital now). Well, that isn't the way, so we turned around and were leaving and T was in front of me. He rode under some scaffolding when I saw what appeared to be shattered glass fall on him. I felt a bit of concern and yelled \"Are you alright? What was that?\" He just brushed it off unhurt and shrugged. A nearby construction worker said \"Don't worry. It's just corn.\" We accepted that fact and moved one.\n\nWe got to a new college campus. This is a very familiar college, but the campus was completely different. I knew where I was, but I have never seen these buildings in real life. T kept going on about how he had good memories in each building we walked past (T did not go to this college). We eventually came across other people and asked where the nearest and best bar was. One person would give an answer and directions, and we would start heading there. Then another person would give an answer, and we would start heading to the new bar. Everyone was talking to T, and I was just going along for the ride. Eventually, we did that 4 or 5 times. I woke up before we ever made it to the bar.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSide Note. I was asleep from 12:30 until I woke up without an alarm at 4:45. I felt like I dreamed the whole time."

There were these women who were twins that were separated into different groups. They both possessed the ability to control fire, but I never witnessed the ability. One twin seemed more aggressive in nature(military minded) than the other, the other more spiritual in what her ability could offer. \n\n  This dream seemed to show that I had history with these people, like this just wasn't a first time meeting at that was it, but more of a, I traveled between them and got to know them. \n\n  Eventually they both approached me wanting me to destroy the other to take their ability.\n\n  My interpretation is that: \n  - fire can be a symbol for spiritual/personal change.\n  \n-the twins represent 2 paths the change can go in, maybe one path is better than the other?\n \n -fire is permanent, which leads me to believe that the choice made can have no recourse.\n \n -if I destroyed one twin, would I take on their philosophy to the ability as well?\n\n  Appreciate everyone who can provide some insight and if there are any questions, please ask away"

They were all teaming up to fight the Wish.com Transformers and were charging them Mad Max style.\n\nThen the scenario changed. We ( a group of people, the only one I remember was a high school friend that I don‚Äôt really talk to much anymore.) had to find ninja turtles in a museum and there was this female villian. She started out on our side as April O‚ÄôNeil, then she turned into another female character who I can‚Äôt pin point. She tricked us and faked her death.

There was a detective and he was accusing me of murder. But i convinced him I was innocent.\n\nI turned into Homer Simpson and was fighting the urge to eat the brain. I felt myself gradually getting more stupid.\n\nBart Simpson came out and said he was behind all this and it was a trick for me to eat brains.\n\nSo I put some brains in a hot dog bun and poured chilli on them and started eating as Homer.\n\nThen I was myself again and this mad scientist was there with this big red and yellow container thing. He was laughing and told me to hide. He flipped a lever switch Frankenstein style. Electricity consumed the container.\n\nI hid and Hulk Hogan came out and found me was about to kill me then my alarm went off‚Ä¶\n\nIt seems like a weird nostalgic trip back to childhood pop culture.

    "body": "A couple years ago I had a dream, maybe a vision, of The Green Man. Ever since then, I had been almost obsessing over this dream and hoping that one day I will have a dream at least somewhat similar. My recollection goes as follows:\n\nIt began with myself in a completely unknown space, one in which that seemed to be underground. There was a lot of vegetation peaking through the cracks of stone and other rock formations. Standing before me was some sort of strange temple, not necessarily a church but a structure similar to one. \n\nThe temple had a soft white glow all throughout it, and much of it's foundation was  some sort of black stone. This temple was covered with vines and other sorts of greenery. As I approached the entrance I pushed open a large door which led me to two spiral staircases. One on the left and one on the right. I went down the stairs and was greeted with some sort of worship room.\n\nThere was a glowing figure in the middle of this room; a shape that I literally cannot describe. It had a glowing pulse and had colors similar to ones you would see on stained glass. It seemed to be constantly collapsing upon itself; again forming shapes that are undescribable. I was in absolute awe. \n\nSuddenly I was greeted by a man whose entire body was made of tree and his face of leaves. He stood right in front of me until only his face took up all of my vision. He told me that I was not supposed to be there with him, at least not yet. I can't remember if he had said anything else. After that I awoke. \n\nI don't believe I had ever seen him in my waking life, so the whole scenario seems rather odd. I was so shook by the dream I immediately searched \"Green Man\" and was presented with the exact same face as I saw in my dream. \n\nDoes anyone have any idea what I witnessed? What does this mean? \n\nTLDR: \nI saw a green man with a face made of leaves in my dream."

The older one wore red shirt while the younger one wore a blue shirt and I also think that they were in like a really poor area cause everywhere they went things were broken or destroyed. Also the older brother had a white bird while the younger one had a black bird.\n\nWhenever the middle brother was with them, the older brother would just sit and look at the ground while the younger brother would laugh with the middle one. But whenever he wasn't with them, the older brother would just stare at the younger brother and I could feel how uncomfortable the younger brother was cause I could feel uncomfortable too .\n\nThe brothers all had olive skin and dark hair but what was different about him was that he had ice blue eyes where the others had brown eyes.\n\nFinally the younger brother told him one day '' why do you keep staring at me ? stop''  and this made the older brother to grab a brick from the ground and hit his younger brother repeatedly in the head and it made blood coming out of the younger brother's head, then he was unzipping his pants when suddenly they were in the middle of a medieval town.\n\nThey were both sitting on a wooden chair and around were people looking at them. In front of them was an old guy with bird and axe who kept hitting the ground with his axe.\n\nFinally the older brother confessed that he was trying to kill his brother and this made the people around him to come and attack him but he somehow escaped and the people were hitting eachother while thinking that they were hitting the boy.\n\nAlso I clearly can remember how one of the people said '' We thought the younger one was bad cause of his black bird but turns out it was the one with white bird all along''"

I was beginning my job as a high school teacher, and the night I had it would have been the end of my first week of this job, which was probably the most stressful week of my whole life. I used to be a heavy pot smoker, and I was detoxing in this month of this dream I‚Äôm talking about. It was a pretty perverse and disturbing dream, and I‚Äôve only ever told my grandpa about it, who I‚Äôve talked to about my dreams since I was a kid. If you‚Äôd rather not hear a dream like that then I‚Äôd ask you not to read further (that feels so cringy to write) \n\nSo this dream I had began in first person with current me picking up a boy who looked like teenage me. I had longer hair at that point, and it was like I recognized myself from behind. He was naked and he was violently throwing up. I picked him up and carried him forward, and I could hear people behind me taunting me as I carried him. Then I had to let him go because I noticed he was beginning to shit himself and freaked out. As I let go, a giant tree began sprouting out of younger me‚Äôs ass, and he let out a scream in agony. This ‚Äútree‚Äù grew rapidly into the biggest tree I have ever seen. It wasn‚Äôt like a tree however, it looked like was made of a tightly stretched pale green fleshy material, and there were eyes all over its trunk and branches. I turned away in horror, and saw a woman standing at a distance in front of me. She turned into some sort of grotesque monster and froze, and at that point it was as if everything zoomed out from my point of view. The monster the woman turned into became a giant penis, and when I looked back to where the flesh tree had been, in its place was a blue-colored palace with statues of beheaded naked women surrounding it. I ran away and came to some sort of house made of reddish wood that had foliage growing inside it as if it hadn‚Äôt been lived in for many years. While looking around this house I remember hearing someone sing a nursery rhyme that had something to do with a liar. The setting of this entire dream was this rural property I used to live on, but the house I fled to was different than any I recognized in real life. That being said, this house was in the same location of the property as this big farmhouse I had visited many times. For context, this property was owned by a commune that my relatives had started, and they used this big farmhouse as a sort of vacation spot for its members, who lived further away in the city.\n\nI am aware of how fucked up detox dreams can be, but this one stands out to me in particular because of how detailed it is and how real it still seems recalling it almost 9 months later. I would be very interested in hearing you all‚Äôs interpretations of it, and I appreciate you reading."

    "body": "(TW:Violence) I recently dreamed that me and my boyfriend were staying at a vacation home in Glasgow, Scotland. I‚Äôve never been there, nor to the house we stayed in. There were 2 other families staying with us. I went into the bathroom on the main floor and there was a grate on the floor overlooking another, very dingy room. All i could see down there was a toilet. I felt compelled to start cupping water from the toilet next to me and throwing it down the grate. When I looked in the mirror I was me but much younger, maybe around 10. When I tried to leave the room a force picked me up and slammed the door. My boyfriend came to check on me and as he did the other families began convening at the bottom of the stairs in the foyer, all with various wounds. Some had nails in their faces and arms. None of them knew what happened. Later in the night we were walking to the kitchen to get water (I didn‚Äôt want to go alone) and as we passed the other rooms we saw the families brutalizing each other with various objects. When we got to the stairs there was a mother and daughter both with icy blonde hair. The daughter had a piccolo and at a nod of her mother, she began to play. I instinctively covered my ears but my boyfriend did not, and as we walked away he began to smile in an incredibly unnatural way. I tried to slap him out of it but he began attacking me and I had to run away. Right before I woke up it cut to a view of earth from space, with all of the people that were in the vacation home seemingly ‚Äúascending‚Äù. It was very reminiscent of the Heaven‚Äôs Gate cult. I could really use some help interpreting this, it was very graphic and it is rare for me to remember my dreams in such detail."

I recently quit smoking weed, which I have done for the past 10 years almost every night, so these are the most vivid dreams I've had since high school. Keep in mind these are one fluid dream and I am at no point actually waking up.\n\nI keep having layered dreams where I'm waking up, in my dream, and falling back asleep and when I fall back asleep it's the real life me living dream me's life but I'm confused and freaked out and in unfamiliar surroundings but all the people I know, mostly my girlfriend and two old friends I don't see much for some reason, but almost all the people I know have been there, are freaked out by me not recognizing everything because this is the life you guys know. I'm just in a completely foreign environment but I have an inkling of recognition. I don't realize it's a dream persay, but I'm confused and freaked out because I have all the memories I normally have when awake, but all my friends are comfortable because they're dream people with dream memories. They're concerned for me.\n\nIn fact, dream me's house is in a real location. It's on a street in a spot where there is a small field. But in my dream that's where my house is.  Then there's always like a storm or an invasion or something, in this case a storm. Rapidly approaching. Lightning is filling the sky in weirdly high pitched tones. It is not raining, it starts snowing heavily. The lightning cracks horizontally immediately above us.\n\n and I'm freaking out trying to figure a way to get us out of the dream land because real life is safe and it's the life I know. (Which is weird because i do not recognize myself as dreaming) I know we would all be safe and happy in real life or the life in my memories or whatever. \n\nEveryone is running to their cars but mine is out of gas. They all want to help but just nothing can be done. Someone has a gas can but it's empty.  but then right before the disasters hit I fake wake up, in my dream, and fall back asleep again in my dream. I don't know if it's restarted or if the storm passes over but I'm okay and just with my one friend I haven't seen in years. \n\nAgain I fake wake up and fall back asleep (all in the dream). This time I'm in a hospital, parts of the ceiling are collapsing and there's dude's with rifles threatening people. It feels like a school shooting, but nobody is getting hurt. I also have a gun and while I'm not scared I am trying to find my way out. I keep tripping into ocean sized bodies of water but as I do I see entire cities submerged. The deeper I get, however, I realize the cities are miniatures. I try to use them to push myself to the top of the water but they crumble in my hands like legos. \n\nThe rest is fuzzy but it keeps going like this until I actually wake up. What's up with this? Same concept everytime one fluid dream where I am falling asleep and waking up in my dream and am trying to find a way to get my dream friends into real life. The common thread is an attempt to connect my dreams to my real reality."

It looked almost like the chamber of secrets in Harry Potter and all of us had similar knowledge of witchcraft as well, no one could get across this stone bridge until I came along and that's when the giant tail of the snake moved out of the way for us to cross. The body of water, if you could call it that, was filled with smaller black poisonous snakes and the entire giant dungeon (or was it outside?) was filled with slithering noises and hisses. We made our way up this stone lookout tower, kicking and swatting snakes on our way, a few of the walls were broken down and the stairs went upward like some sort of spiral, the pit that would've been another level of stairs, was filled as well. When we reached the top of the tower you could see something giant move through the body of \"snakes\" around and inside of the tower, then quickly emerging to pounce an attack against me. Landing a huge fang into my left hand and forearm. I quickly muttered a spell incantation before biting a chunk off and digging my nails into the giant black snake, transferring back it's own poison at full force. It let out a yelp that echoed in the air before letting me go and submerged itself again. There was a boy, who was suppose to resemble draco malfoy, got taken by the giant black snake and whom I tried to save but couldn't. Not without jumping into the pit of poisonous snakes."

But water started coming in and I told Bill to climb up the hill in front of us. I went first and it was overgrown and kinda steep. I could see a clearing at the top and blue skies. Once at the top I saw weird machines, with controls on them, kinda like you'd see in a control room. There were probably 5 machines in a row. Some man appeared behind me and told me those controlled weather in all parts of the world. Then there were 4 more men that appeared. The first man went over to one machine and showed me the names of some countries and said that he could cause hurricanes, and floods. And i saw the name Sweden and he did something to cause bad weather there. I didn't like what he was doing, I felt uneasy.

But for some reason, this dream I had last night, for the first time ever, I had this intense intuitive feeling that the dream was telling me something, but I have no idea what!\n\nBackground information that may be relevant to my dream: My parents have been divorced since I was like 10, I moved out at 19, I've always been extremely independent, I'm very close to both my parents but we do have complex relationships due to past hurts/tensions/traumas caused by them (definitely closest with my Dad though), my brother and I are BEST friends (he's younger, I was a Mom to him for a long time so we have a best friend connection but also mother/son in a way), I have been dealing with some stress lately around the relationships in my life (not family relationships though, but all others). I've also been with my partner for about three years - but he was not in the dream. I've also had some stress lately around feeling like there's so many people dependent/relying on me and that I lack freedom/independence. \n\nAnyway, the dream took place in the apartment I currently live in. Except, my dogs and partner were not there/I didn't even know about them in the dream. It was my Dad, Mom (although I didn't actually see her in the dream, I just knew she was there, and she was together with my Dad), myself and my little Brother. The strange thing, was my parents had the master bedroom (which is currently mine and my partner's bedroom IRL) in the dream. The room my Mom has IRL was like another bedroom, but I wasn't sure whose it was. It didn't feel like mine. There was also someone sitting in a wheelchair in that room (my Mom occasionally uses one, but I know it wasn't her in the chair, I don't think it was my brother either but I'm unsure).\n\nThe dream started in my living room, there was a jet black bug with bright BRIGHT orange on it's side. It was on the ceiling. I'm a bit scared of bugs, so in the dream I freaked out and tried to catch that bug in a cup and release it outside. But the bug kept escaping, I also could not figure out what type of bug it was. I called my Dad over to help catch it, he tried and couldn't, then gave up and said to just forget about it. Then he went back into his room (my room IRL). I tried catching the bug again but it disappeared I think? So I decided to go into that second bedroom (that is my Mom's IRL) with the wheelchair person (possibly my brother but idk? It's like my brain doesn't want me to know about that person). I notice a HUGE bug on the ceiling there too! This one is bigger, a lot longer. It's grey and black (light grey mixed with black). I decide I'm going to squish it, because it's gross/scares me. But I just can't squish it! I took a picture of it and found online that it was a beetle (in my dream), so I started wondering if that first bug was also a beetle. After repeatedly trying to squish it, the bug like jumped down/almost landed on me and went away. That's all I remember before waking up.\n\nNormally, I don't think my dreams have messages. But I've had this nagging intense feeling that this dream HAD a message for me.. I just can't figure out what. I'm confused why the bugs were the centre of the dream, why my parents were there but unhelpful/off to the side, that my partner wasn't there, etc. Any ideas? I can provide more info on myself if it helps! Thank you so much if you have any input."

Second, I have two recurring dreams...one is a tidal wave dream, which I feel is fairly self-explanatory. The other is when I am travelling from point A to B, and it's always, say, where I had my home before my divorce, and when I travel, it's never by conventioanl means. No bus, car, train, etc. It's always some sort of device that requires my arms to propel me, like a sled, or a board with wheels. The terrain is always 'iffy,' the speeds can be overwhelming but I control them with my feet or hands dragging on the wheels to slow me down. I'd appreciate your thoughts."

    "body": "My friend never remembers her dreams. But a couple of years ago, she had an extremely vivid dream involving a man. She could clearly see every detail of her room, the man, the clothes she was wearing, etc. The man had a distinct symbol on his body that she took a note of. You can probably imagine what happened when they both got into bed. Needless to say, she woke up feeling extremely sore. She told her sister and I about it the next day, and we did some research. We ended up finding a symbol that was an identical match to what she saw in her dream- \"The Raven of Lust\". \n\nA few weeks later, she was sitting in her room late at night when a black cat suddenly appeared on her balcony (NOTE: it would have been very difficult for a cat to get up there). A few minutes later, a mini mirror that was on her desk toppled over and smashed. That night, she dreamed of him again. Except this time, he was more aggressive. She woke up with a red handprint on her stomach. I had told her that she might've made the mark in her sleep, however the hand was noticeably bigger than hers. \n\nI randomly remembered this a few years later, and was wondering if anyone knew stuff about it. I've told a couple of my friends about her experience and they are not convinced they are dreams, however I do not what else to classify this as. I still feel these are dreams that she had but neither of us can explain her remembering them or the mark that was left or the feeling of soreness."

I was showing her how to play but could sense I was in the wrong place in the game and was panicking and trying to tell her but she went under the water as the dragon came in and disappeared, i was trapped and the dragon got my arm and then pulled me up, it felt painful and I knew it was wrong as it shouldn‚Äôt have hurt and should have ended if caught but it hurt and kept going. I knew it was the end and just gave in and the dragon killed me then everything ended and nothing. I was slowly aware of others in the same situation, just in nothing, nowhere and scared, sad and confused because their games had all ended badly and brought them into nothingness too. Suddenly we were together and a room started forming around us in the nothingness. Then it was just me in more of a room with a reassuring woman telling me to relax, everything was just coming back online and it took time, this was the most TNG it got as it was deffo a Star Trek type room and had sliding doors that she exited through, it might have even been Natasha Yar. In the corner by the doors was some kind of being, it was blue. When the woman was there it was a person but the moment she went out of the room the lights went ambient and it turned into a shape and it was menacing, I had a sense that it was real whereas she was not and that it was observing me. \n\nI woke up at this point with my heart thumping and properly on edge."

There's a skinless chicken, that looks like human. Human head, no human legs, just feet, and human arms that was morphed into a chicken. The customer asked what it was and told her that I never seen it before. Then she walks from a distance and the thing came towards her and hugs her from the waist. He loses his arms and falls down and dies, then she falls down and dies. I left the room immediately.\n\n2nd dream was similar, but this was on a old man.

Any thoughts?\n\nAgain mind the order and typos.\n\nIn our home looking for something. Family is over but they've irritated us. We're in our bedroom bathroom.  Something is where the book closet is. A wall? I rip it down. A second shower hidden on the right. And a sealed door right in front. Break apart the covering. A light under the Crack in the door. Open it. Pale boy, blurry, unclothed. Mouth stretched gaping open. Starting at me screaming silently. Middle of a hidden room in my home. Dark bed, blue sheets? A single standing lamp with a black pole near the bed. Boy on the rug staring at you, screaming. The room was almost rounded. Made of all tightly placed wood boards of different lengths and age.  The voice said it means you have 33 days before something comes for you.  Slam the door, run. My wife sees my fear. I explain, unsure how i know. She believes me. The door creaks open. How? It's the boy but different. Larger, taller. In the doorway now. It slammed back shut. I tell Sara to leave. She runs to the door and barricades it. We tell everyone we have to leave.  In another area, beach like.  Florida? Night time. Massive storm.  Running from something, traffic, panic.  Son is hurt.  The kids are brave.  Wife is too. We run into people, crowds everywhere. Night.  Hanging bulb lights in the streets. Ethnic looking area.  We stole a car to run. Everyone is running. Storm worse. Driving across a bridge. Boats everywhere fleeing. Water coming from both ways on the bridge. We all have to jump. Son broke his arm. I carry him and Daughter through the water and wife helps pull us out. I'm still sick. We get to shore. On the beach. Cut through a few small alleyways. Run into someone I may early on. No help. Looking for a hospital. We reset sons arm on the way. He says he's fine to walk. We start moving and look up. Something big.  More than one. Like this is the end and they are here for us."

When I opened the door there were about 5 complete strangers standing stating they were sent there by an app. I instantly thought of geocaching. But they were adamant about entering the home. I refused and they all started getting hostile. The guy closest to me pushed through the door and just out of instinct I attacked him and he killed him. In between managing my shock of what happen, I realized that I had left the door wide open but no one entered the house. When I went to close it a girl stepped in and I just decided to shut the door and ‚Äúhold her hostage‚Äù since I was winded and needed to wake my family members up for help. I tried waking up my brother, cousin, and uncle but they kept falling asleep. My grandma woke up by herself and was the only one to stay up.

But, You said that the intensive enjoyment of   misery comes only from ignorance as in the case of Human incarnation.   How to reconcile these two in the case of the human being, wishing to   enjoy the misery?‚Äù\n\n**Swami replied:**  If you take the case of Human  incarnation, It is a two component  system in which the unimaginable God  and imaginable human being  co-exist. ***The  nature of the human  being is always ignorance and the intensive  experience of the misery  can be attained by God when God identifies  with such ignorant human  being just like an iron rod associated with  hot rod also becomes hot.***  The basic concept of the  realisation of the unreal nature of the world  with respect to God  already exists with the unimaginable God, which  gives the enjoyment of  misery without attachment.\n\nThus,  both ignorance  (Avidya) and realisation of knowledge (Vidya) co-exist  with the  unimaginable God and both these are used separately as per the   requirement of the context. In the case of a wise human being also   seeing the cinema, the enjoyment of misery is possible because the   unreal nature of the cinema is already realised by the wise human being,   which forms the basis of detachment. The scene of the cinema can   influence the spectator and make him forget this realisation and   detachment. The intensive effect of the scene can bring the ignorance   even in the case of a wise man. Hence, the attachment to the scene due   to the ignorance makes him enjoy it based on his earlier realisation.\n\n***The enjoyment of misery is based on detachment and the depth of the experience is based on the ignorance***.   Thus, there is an altering shifts of ignorance and realisation. It is   the state of a sort of mixture of both knowledge and ignorance present   in Him causing the deep experience and enjoyment together. The  ignorance  gives deep experience of the misery. The realisation makes  you enjoy  the misery without attachment. In the case of an ordinary  human being,  only ignorance prevails giving the deep experience of  misery and the  enjoyment is absent due to lack of realisation. ***The realisation can come only by achieving nearness to God through devotion.***\n\nThrough  mere knowledge, the realisation is only theoretical and cannot  be  experienced. The practical experience comes only by the grace of God.   The followers of Advaita philosophy do not have this devotion since   they feel themselves as God. Due to this, there is no grace of God on   them. Since they are God, God cannot show grace on Himself. Due to this,   even though theoretical realisation is there, they fail to enjoy the   misery."

I sleep at least 3 hours a day because of my bipolar disorder and other factors, but I‚Äôve been going through alot recently. Today I finally got the chance to sleep most of the day away and it‚Äôs the most sleep I‚Äôve gotten in weeks but I had a dream this time.\n\n\nFor some reason my teeth were hurting so I started pulling them out, one by one and then I replaced them with small metal tubes that I had to screw new teeth in. And that‚Äôs what I did, put in new teeth and walked around for awhile until they started hurting again. This time I had to unscrew them and then pull the metal tubes out. Everytime I pulled a tube out it physically hurt me in my dream, they‚Äôd come out with chunks of my jaw meat or whatever from the sockets and when I finally got to the last couple teeth I woke up.  It was a weird surreal feeling and I don‚Äôt understand why I could feel it while I slept. What could it mean?"

    "body": "I‚Äôve been having a novel, confusing, and somewhat alarming experience lately and looking for some insight if possible.\n\nA little background first: all of my life I have been very aware of my dreams.  Since childhood they were long, vivid, and I often remember much, if not most of them when I wake up (or at least it feels that way).  There are recurring themes, emotions, and experiences within them that I have come to have a spectrum of reactions to.  Some I enjoy, some are merely interesting, and some have fear, dread, sadness, and other negative feelings.  But even the unpleasant ones have become familiar enough that they don‚Äôt upset me. Furthermore, though not a lucid dreamer, I have come to have a certain amount of ability to redirect dreams that are taking a too-uncomfortable direction.  It‚Äôs not exactly control, but more like a degree of influence.\n\nHowever, in the last few days I have had two dreams that felt like novel experiences, and were distressing.\n\nIn both cases, a character in one of my dreams did something unfamiliar, unexpected, and threatening in a way I‚Äôve never experienced.\n\nIn one dream, a character in the dream was able to shut me out of a room.  I was trying to get in because I thought a loved was in there, in distress, and wanted to get in. My response in these cases is usually to ‚Äúpush‚Äù my way into a room.  I can usually ‚Äúoverpower‚Äù a scenario like this in my dreams to get into the room, or if that is proving difficult, re-direct into another scenario.  But in this case I could do neither, and I felt the intention and ability of whoever was on the other side of the door in keeping me out.  I immediately woke myself up but it was one of the most frightening dream experiences I‚Äôve ever had.\n\nThen something that felt similar happened a couple days later.  I had a dream where I was driving a car at night through a semi-crowded area, sort of a downtown area.  I was coming up to an intersection and noticed a portly, bearded man walking across the street in my general direction.  He noticed me stopped at the light, and began to walk my way.  I started to roll the window up, because I sensed threat from him.  The window wouldn‚Äôt roll up, and he was closing quickly, so I attempted to put my foot on the gas, but got no response.  He arrived at my car and leaned in, reaching across me as if to grab whatever he could from inside the car. I attempted to push him out, but he was insanely strong, and has he reached into the car he began saying ‚ÄúAny, any, any, any‚Äù in a kind of crazed, maniacal voice, and his arm elongated freakishly, as if to get further inside.  I immediately woke myself up.\n\nThe power of both these character to impose their will in my dream felt novel, alien, and threatening.  And over several decades I‚Äôve become quite familiar with my own dreaming experiences, or at least what I remember about them.  These felt totally new and quite frightening.  Any thoughts or insights would be most welcome."

    "body": "I was on the subway in New York and a woman came on the train who seemed not in her right mind because she was laughing and smiling in a weird way. When the woman got on the train and the doors closed there was a gunshot that hit a guy in his arm. I immediately crouched down trying to not be noticed and praying for the doors to open. But I couldn't stop this sound from escaping my throat (I imagine I might actually have been making a noise). It was kind of like a humming. The crazy woman with the gun came right up to me and sat next to me with the gun pointing at me. She smiled and I realized I didn't want to die and it felt a bit like a revelation as until recently I wanted to be someone else. I really wanted to live the life I was in. I said \"Please I don't want to die\" and the woman laughed and shot me in the neck. I felt the blood flooding up and I was surprised it was not painful. I felt this person behind me attempting to put pressure on the wound but I knew there was no saving me. I was just thankful it was not painful. Then I was walking down a hallway in the subway with someone-  not sure who. I could tell I had a wound on my neck but it was healing and I was so surprised to be alive. I turned around to thank the person that saved me. I couldn't tell who it was. I was so confused as to how I had survived it felt like a miracle."

I was in my childhood nyc apartment but it was somehow a shop in a strange rural town. I don't remember how I got there or how I knew it was a shop in this place but I knew it was. I was standing in the living room waiting for the shopkeeper. The people in the dream were mainly family members but I never had the feeling they knew I was their family. Suddenly I caught sight of a savage/feral handicapped child who was violently running around in it aimlessly looking to bite and attack. I locked my eyes on him to make sure I could keep a distance and remain safe, I was so intently focused on him that I was shocked and startled when I felt something against my outer thigh through my pants. I whipped around and a revolting looking hunchbacked pregnant hermaphrodite with a staff and a fetal alcohol syndrome face was standing behind me and rubbing their penis up and down against my leg, I zoomed in like a comic book as they smeared a weak dribble of ejaculate against me. At this point the house burst into laughter and someone yelled out \"oh looks like you've met the priestess\" and I was terrified and horrified and fled into my bedroom and barricaded the door. I tried to pack a bag but couldn't find clothing and bent down repeatedly to look through the key hole to discretely gesture for help to a family member but was never understood. Then all of a sudden through the keyhole I could see that all the lights cut out at once and something soon began barreling and hurling itself at my plywood door. I could feel wood bulge and the hinges coming loose as I strained to heave myself against it. I was leaning into it with all my weight and power trying to keep it shut when the door began to glow with heat and my body began burning everyplace it was wedged against the door trying to keep it shut. At this point  I woke up"

Entities do not answer, or cannot answer any direct questioning. I get the sense they cannot because in there I am their god? \n\nTonight‚Äôs dream was different. \n\nTHE DREAM\nI was standing in front of a heavily fortified hospital. They had guards, fences, and security. There were others at the gate. I said to the crowd, ‚Äòif you are all me‚Ä¶ then we can all break in‚Ä¶‚Äô we did but there was no resistance. \n\nInside it was a brightly lit hospital. Many rooms, stairs, I was searching for the one who would provide answers. The being that ran ‚Äúthe hospital‚Äù. \n\nI went through many doors with the crowd. We were not stopped or followed, it was rather easy getting in. But it was empty. \n\nImagine an empty hospital.\n\nWe finally came to an odd staircase. Like MC Esher. It went up, and down, I kept thinking the head of a hospital would be ‚Äúup‚Äù in an office‚Ä¶ but something inside me felt like I should go down. Which I did. \n\nDownstairs There I was in an immense lobby, high ceilings, four entry/exits. Large class doors. There was a large marble table where I knew I would meet ‚Äúthe one‚Äù‚Ä¶ instead another entity came, they put a placemat in front of me‚Ä¶ \n\nI asked what was my reason for being here, how should I live my life. \n\nThe placemat began speaking. \n\nSome of the things it said were what I felt claimed was ‚Äúpedantic‚Äù(the word I said to it but don‚Äôt use a normal conversation). This was me replying to things it said to me. Apparently I had been told these things before? And was frustrated hearing the same things over and over again. \n\nI asked the placemat if we live in a world that is a simulation. \n\nIt responded that we live in a simulation that is based on ‚Äúperiodic determination‚Äù.\n\n(This scared me, I don‚Äôt know why‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt even know what that meant.. if just gibberish) \n\nThat I should get up, enjoy my day tomorrow, eat well and enjoy life. \n\nThe scene changed. \n\nI was now Outside. Knew I was dreaming and was shaken trying to remember the phrase‚Ä¶ ‚Äúwe live in a universe of periodic determination‚Äù; I kept thinking I don‚Äôt know what the hell that means. \n\nI tried waking myself up, the way I have learned to do when I lucid dream. It wasn‚Äôt working. A car pulled up to tell me to go to the dry cleaners. I had things waiting. \n\nI WOKE UP‚Ä¶. \n\nI looked up all the iterations of ‚Äúperiodic determination‚Äù in relation to universe. Basically it means one or two things:\n\nThe universe we live in is like a video game simulation, or updates procedurally. Like when a character walks it renders the field ahead. \n\nOr \n\nIt could mean that between big bang, Big Crunch‚Ä¶ those are periodic events. \n\nI don‚Äôt know. This is not my speciality.

My wife and son take a route along a high bluff that is an easier walk than the route. My sister-in-law and I take up the hill. We get up to the top of the hill. It's sort of a slushy spring. There are terrorist meltwater pools to the left and a clear sloping bath to our right. Sort of like a ski hill in the spring. There's another man walking along the cleared path but there's lots of puddles and slush so I walk on a somewhat dry sperm. Between the path and the pools. We get about halfway down. My sister-in-law suggests we walk in the path because it's dried out and it's less slippery than the burm we're on.\n\nWe get down to the town, it's looks like a modern version of the shanty town and Robin Williams film Popeye. Coming into the town we know where to meet my wife and son, but as we go through the town notice a lot of seafood restaurants. This is interesting because recently I've been thinking about how hard it is to find a nice seafood place in the city we live. We meet my wife and son at the restaurant and go inside to order.\n\nMy wife, son, and I order fish fries. My sister-in-law, who doesn't like fish, orders, the fried shrimp. Shrimp. The waitress tells us they're out of fried shrimp so she orders the grilled shrimp. My wife and her sister get up to go to the bathroom. My son and I talk about how it's hard to find seafood where we live, and I realize that there is an oven under the high top we're sitting at and I try to start preheating it because I realize we have to cook our own food. Food. At least heated up. My son asks about getting a drink, he's recently been introduced to the kitty cocktail. So I write it down on some paper how he is to ask the bartender for his drink and he goes up to the bar.\n\nMy wife and sister-in-law return. My wife asks where my son is. She rolls her eyes but lets him order his own drink. We eat our food and have a nice time. I notice across the restaurant, a woman and a man. The man is Michael fassbender but he's playing a part, sort of a sleazy version of himself. But she's playing herself. We decide to get a room for the night.\n\nThe next scene I'm in the foyer of the hotel portion of the restaurant. Talking to the host. I turn on the TV and realize there is some sort of spy camera in the room of the man I saw in the restaurant. It proceeds to show me a very graphic sex scene between the man and the woman. Like, pornographic. The kind of pornographic that I find pretty revolting in real life, and I found it revolting in the dream. Then I wake up.\n\nSome additional notes : I do really like Emelia Clarke. Both as an actor and, of course find her very attractive. Michael fassbender, I really appreciate as an actor, and he's also pretty handsome. I currently work in chaplaincy, but I have been retraining for the last 4 months to do voice over work."

I feel curious if my subconscious has determined already that she IS trustworthy, hence used her in my dream to try to get me out of the fantasy.  \n\n\nBTW I have been talking to someone new who has shown a lot of promise as a possible bf, he's incredible, sweet and drives 2 hours to spend time with me on the weekends, he's caring and knows my heart was broken and showed a lot of compassion when I was feel really afraid of him hurting me.  \nI hadn't really thought about the other guy a whole lot except for the time I was afraid, so it came as a surprise when I had a full dream just about him."

A lot of the details are fuzzy now. I remember my father arguing with me about something bigoted. Probably about my gender identity or sexuality (ace) so he is yelling and stuff. I tried to speak up to confront him (something I've always been too terrified in real life) but as I tried to speak my voice went horse. Enough was said that I basically told him to F off and im leaving for good back to my flat. He then refuses to go to work until I leave. Then somehow my ex showed up in my bed. For context we had a very toxic relationship, she abused me a lot physically, emotionally, spiritually, and sexually for 5 years. My father then tries to kick her out. I remember trying to get up to shower but somehow my bed and bedding was in the shower. I know more happened but it's all fuzzy now."

I had arrived on time not knowing about this number system. I made friends with new people, strangers, and ran into many people that I‚Äôve known before. It was like we were all tailgating until the person‚Äôs number was called and they were whisked away. Everyone kept asking me what my number was, so I had to say 6641 over and over. I woke up wondering if the numbers had meaning. From google, all I could find really is ‚ÄúThey encourage you to face your fears head-on. Never give up just because you failed once or twice. Keep going.‚Äù Just the words ‚ÄúKeep going‚Äù mean a lot to me right now, because I am young and the last 3 years of my life, health-wise, have been hell. \n\nWas just wondering if anyone else had any other views on the dream/the numbers üñ§ thank you for reading"

The bear didn‚Äôt have any cotton inside of it it was just the skin of the bear with my niece inside it. Then she came outside of the teddy bear and started coming at me while mumbling??? While all this was happening I was saying Bismillah and like praying, but my prayers don‚Äôt do anything (which happens in all my dreams where anything like this happens even when I was a kid) my possessed niece is still coming towards me slowly and her lips were pale and her eyes were almost gray and she had really dark dark circles. It felt so real even in the dream I managed to convince myself that it wasn‚Äôt a dream, but then I woke up just as my niece was about to attack me. Idk why but in my dream I just knew that it was a jinn possessing my niece. Idk what it meant but I would love to know if it means anything."

I had the thought of like \"what the heck, lets see if I can crawl out of my body\". So I began to imagine what it would feel like and instead of crawling I just gracefully floated out. I stood at my bedroom door wanting to open it. I was also like a foot shorter than irl. I couldn't open the door but instead I started phasing through the wall. \n\nI wanted to stop on the other side of my door but I just kept floating and ended up floating through the next wall. It reminded me of when you noclip in a video game. \n\nI woke up for a brief moment after that.\n\nShortly after I released from my body again. This time I was able to interact with the door. \n\nFor some reason instead of trying to go outside (I've yet to successfully reach the outside world in a lucid dream) I had this urge to go to the bathroom and flush my hand. I walked into the bathroom but the lights were off and wouldn't turn on. So I walked over to the toilet in darkness and put my left hand in the water. I tried flushing it with my right hand but it was like I couldn't apply enough force. \n\nIn pretty much every lucid dream I fear that applying too much force to anything will make my physical body move and wake me up so I think that manifests as lack of strength in the dream world. \n\nI woke up shortly after trying to flush it though. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI just find it so strange that I had this like conscious knowing that I had to flush my hand for some reason."

    "body": "I (20f) just woke up from a nap. I went to watch a movie (Makoto Shinkai's Suzume) today alone, came back and fell asleep. Then I saw this dream. \nI am living with my mom in a house that looks nothing like ours. It's in a village. The village has a really high road, like a hill. And all houses are stuck on either side. You climp up to the high road to travel to others places or gain access to a car. I was reading about a weird zombie apocalypse thingy that affected the village many many years ago. A family had done something in the kitchen which caused it and the zombies had taken over the entire village. I told mom about it and she heard and said that it won't happen again even though it's unknown why it happened in the first place. \nMy mom was baking some tomato and olive bread and then it happened. The walls of our kitchen started to bang. BANG! BANG! It was so loud. It burst open and a lot of zombies came out. They started frantically running around. Some has their arms ripped off, half a foot gone, head almost cut and dangling from the neck, face half gone. At first it seemed that they weren't capable of seeing and so we sneakily slipped away and got in my bedroom and locked the room. We heard them break our door and leave.\nWe came out and thinking how to deal with it and went back to the kitchen to see that it was completely ordinary and nothing was broken. It was just the way it was. The bread was done and so we took it out cooled it and were about to eat when someone came in. Our kitchen has a tiny veranda overlooking the slope and a zombie girl came in. She was cut all over but it wasn't as bad as the others, she only has a chunk of her shoulder missing and her skin was yellow and green. She was wearing a pink dress and had a veil on, covering her head but not her face. She sat down at the dining table beside me and was staring into space and then she looked at my direction.  We weren't moving a muscle so after what felt like a millennium she left. The next day she came back did the same thing. The 3rd day she said, \"Don't be scared. I won't turn you into one of us. And I am the only one left the others turned into humans when they reached the high road. They can't see me anymore. I am not strong enough to turn people and I am to scared to go to the high road alone.\" We were so shocked that we couldn't say anything. She left us again. For the next few weeks or so she would come and just wave at me from the window of the kitchen veranda. I don't know when but I started waving back. She smiled, I thought she was cute. She had started to look less dead to the point where she just has a bunch of scars on her face and body. We once had a friend over for lunch and he looked at her and said, \"Oh who's that? She's so beautiful, a skin so pearl white and smooth!\" It told us that he couldn't see the scars. A friend from a distant land I said to which he laughed and asked us why she's in the veranda to which I said she likes looking at the valley! He asked if I could just ask her to come in. I had to comply. The moment I asked her to come in she lit up, hugged me tight and kissed my cheek. She smelled sweet. Our friend started talking to her and she was hugging my arm the entire time.\nA few weeks later, there was a movie show at our community open air theatre. Mom 2as away on a business trip. I was there with many others and we were having fruit bites and juice. The girl I had a crush on was there and I was talking to her. Nimita (the zombie girl) was walking around near me but had disappeared after I had started talking to my crush. I looked everywhere for her frantically, calling out her name. Then she called me from behind. I turned immediately and hugged, I scolded her and told her how worried I was. She asked me why do I care about her so much if I already have a person to love...to which I looked at her and gave her a deep kiss on the lips and told her that I love her. I took her hand walked up the slope to the high road and she turned human, losing her scars. I looked at her, she was about to kiss me and then I woke up.\n\nPS - I should add that this is also my first dream which was weeks long. My longest was a day and 2 nights long.\nI just want to know why I saw a dream about a zombie girl falling in love with me and me falling in love with her.\nHelp"

Then, my coworker appeared (looked fine and healthy, no blood) and completely drained the tub and showed me the sink, where I washed the blood off my finger. \n\nDoes this have any meaning? Glad to give more context if needed!"

Husband became distant I got pregnant again. And in my dream gave birth to a daughter she was still born or passed shortly after I can‚Äôt remember now.

The scene was outside and it was a rainy climate, gloomy and off-white, which is my favorite. Also I vaguely remember a vision of a girl who put a knife in her mouth pointed upwards and rubbed it, which was like separating her skin from her face.

And when I went out to check where exactly we were, I saw valleys of sand, very tall and big statues with their arms crossed like an x, ancient historical ones, tall ancient towers like Pisa or something from Roman or even Renaissance architecture, it was so beautiful it looked like a default desktop wallpaper. Another thing to mention was that it looked very similar to Valley of the Kings from Egypt (I think that's what it's called). \n\nWhile passing by, I saw signs of old, ancient currencies of money (more specifically, they were coins or the symbols stamped on them), ones that were abandoned. I kept seeing them and I believed that it was a good sign to get us out of a predicament. \n\nBecause just around this time, my parents realized they were stuck in the middle of nowhere and not in any country. We don't where we were or how we even got there aside from being in a flight we agreed to go to (details of this are more foggy now). Of course they were sent in a frenzy and panicked greatly. \n\nSince we still had online classes, I called a friend to ask to send help but I couldn't hear them much until I heard a voice of another classmate and asked if I could be excused from classes today due to our current situation. \n\nSo a little backstory from what's happening in our lives right now: \n\nWe were suppose to immigrate to the U.S this month but got delayed hard due to retrogression and now we don't know what's going to happen next.

Much like a dungeon. Dark, stone, cold, wet. In front of me was a person on the ground. No details of this person. Couldn't even say if it was male or female. Just on their back facing up. I quickly swooped down and leaned over to whisper into their left ear. As I started whispering, the voice and \"words\" that came out of my mouth were like nothing I ever heard before. Some type of speech unlike any language I've ever heard. As I said whatever these words were I said them faster and faster, not repeating. Then I felt cold slits on my back by my shoulder blades. I could feel some type of cold shadow that felt like wings behind me, but the cold and shadow was being sucked into me, faster and faster. Right before I woke it felt like two giant cold wings behind me sucking in with such a great force that I started to have a feeling of \"oh no\" what have I done. I felt like I had let something in that I shouldn't. The feeling was such a rush, it felt powerful but dark. This is when I woke up and As I lay in bed awake I could still feel the cold slits on my back. My heart was racing and my back continued to tingle and feel cold for nearly 5 min. That's its. Other point of note, nothing happened to the person I was whispering to, no reaction, they weren't hurt or anything. More of just a prop, they could have possibly been dead, but I can't say for sure."

She noticed that I had a deck in my coat pocket though and asked to use those. I gave them to her and she shuffled them and once again pulled the Hermit.

    "body": "Hi all, new to this subreddit. I'm 23F ENFP and I had a dream last night that I've been thinking about. I was wondering if anyone could share their two cents.\n\n\nIt started with me in a room that I knew was my bedroom, but nowhere I have ever lived before. Currently, in real life, I live with roommates away from my family. In this dream, however, I was living with my dad and brother in a home on the water unknown to me, but I didn't question it at all. It started with me looking out the window, and I thought the lights streaming through the blinds and window were so pretty, so I was trying to record it with my phone. I could never get the video just right though, because waves were coming and would mess with how the light streamed through the window. \n\nI watched from my bed as waves grew outside, and I thought the sound was calming and the waves were pretty. The window was open with a screen on it. Eventually, the waves kept getting bigger and were knocking against the window (second floor of this house). I wasn't scared - I specifically remember thinking it was pretty - not worried at all even when the water started seeping through the window screen lightly. Eventually, the window started to leak water in a mildly concerning way, so I got a bucket to try to collect the water and stop it from damaging the carpet and items in my room. I had to close the window. The waves kept growing and hitting the window harder, until (if I recall correctly), the window leaked/the panes were getting damaged and I couldn't block out the waves. \n\nMy brother and dad came in, and watched as I tried to collect the water. I think they gave me a bigger bucket, but eventually I needed to leave the house. I was worried that my knickknacks and mementos would get damaged, but I couldn't take them with me. I went outside and giant masses of peoplerwere trying to swim away from the tsunami waves - it was strange since there were cars driving through the water in the same area everyone was swimming -I remember being worried the cars would hit me as I swam through them. I had to lift up my arms so they saw me - but there was a giant crowd of hundreds of people trying to swim alongside me. \n\nThe dream continued in this manner - I would swim in the flooded areas away from the giant waves/tsunami to the other side of the land where I'd find another house facing calm water. In that house we would be relieved at being safe, but eventually, that side of the ocean/river's water would have waves increasingly grow. Once they became tsunamis, we'd have to swim back to the other side. That went on a bunch of times, with me seeing special guest star appearances from friends in my real life. They'd enter my house for safety, or we'd swim across the flood to the next house together. \n\nI don't remember ever feeling very scared - maybe worried at times, but it didn't feel like a nightmare at any point. I think I found the waves pretty most of the time, but of course, was trying to consistently get to safety since I knew it would not be good to get caught in them. They were some other details, such as conversations with the friends or what we might have done at the houses. At one house, we found a trafficking ring (weird??) and I had to collect my friends and rush them to the next house away from that , and there we ended up being given formal dresses and had a formal event with tennis and ping pong (I don't know why that was at a formal gala lol). Each house ended the same though, after about twenty minutes we'd have to swim away when the tsunamis started coming from the other side. No houses were ever damaged or destructed by the waves - just flooded then we'd move on. \n\nAt one of the houses, I remember blocking people from coming in after a while. Only letting people in I knew - in the dream I remember thinking it was a bitchy move since people had let me in their house. I was just concerned about it getting chaotic with a lot of people and things would get damaged or something along those lines. Don't worry, awake me doesn't agree, haha.\n\nWhether they were tsunamis or just giant waves, I'm not sure. Curious what you all may think about this.\n\n\nContext:\nFor context on my life since it's suggested to add, I'm 23, recently graduated from college last Spring. I went home to live with my brother and dad between college and getting a job in my major (I waitressed in the meantime). In January 2023, I got a job in my major that is in the city I went to college (I am very happy to be with all my friends again!). Not sure if it's relevant, but I like my job and it's a great starting point, but not exactly fulfilling as it's not the specific area of my major I want to be in, but I know that it will get me where I want to be especially since this is the very beginning of my professional career. Helps that I like my coworkers a lot, too. \n\nI have been thinking about my future lately - where I may move to next when my friends and I all eventually have to go separate ways as our lives/careers take us to new places. One friend is moving for law school this summer, another is hoping to leave the state next year, another looking at jobs in another state, etc. I hope to even leave the state soon once my friends scatter, not interested in recreating memories in the same place with new people, but rather wanting to go somewhere new and experience new things. I am happy with it all now, but know that things are bound to change since that's what 20s are for.\n\nLet me know! Sorry if this is a lot of information and words."

The whole time, I‚Äôm trying to prove it is a dream or not a dream. I‚Äôm hitting myself, everything. Because it happens so often but everytime, it‚Äôs so real. I feel every ounce of pain. But then as I was beating the crap out of my thighs, they started to disappear. Then I realized I‚Äôm in a simulation (Not a dream. But just life) when I stood up and I got vibrations in my body like DMT.. I need help figuring out my teeth situation. \n\nThen I was driving on the highway and hit a cone. The cone didn‚Äôt move but it completely stopped my car and I felt every bit of it. I felt the concussion and saw and felt myself losing consciousness. \n\nThen this is random but I want to know if anyone else has had this happen. It‚Äôs happened twice in the last week. I dreamed about hitting a dab. But like too much concentrate so I was immediately having to close my eyes and take all that thc at once. I don‚Äôt even dab often. I don‚Äôt have any clue why I‚Äôm doing that and getting that high in dreams but does anyone else FEEL high In dreams? Why am I having so much pain and feeling in my dreams?

    "body": "This is today's I might write previous ones if and when i remember,, I get some weird dreams lately (very different to eachother too)\n\nWriting this before I start forgetting details\n\n\"I was on a trip with my dad and we were both angry with each other, not speaking a word. While on the road, we stopped at a public restroom where I coincidentally ran into an old school friend whose father was a police inspector. I was leaving when my dad joined us, and I tried to embarrass him in front of my friend. I often do this as I believe my father is a bad and mean person who mistreated me and my siblings throughout our childhood. He also plays the victim and claims that we do not appreciate him, which is not true as he earns more than 125k but we live on less than 5k rupees with no assets or investments. Despite his salary, we still lack basic amenities. During our conversation, my friend commented that I do not appreciate my father's sacrifices, which only angered me more. I asked my friend to tell my dad what his father had done for him, and he recounted how his father died in action. However, my dad questioned his finances, and once again, he mocked me for not realizing the importance of his money. This frustrated me even more because I work hard in a menial job to earn a living and never ask my father for money, yet he still claims that he sponsors me. As we were leaving, my dad abandoned me midway and asked me to walk home. It was during this intense traffic situation that he pressured me to cross a busy road, and I almost got hit by a vehicle. I decided to wait on the side and let the traffic clear before crossing. Suddenly, I witnessed a horrific event where a man on a scooter was shot by another man, causing his whole leg to disappear. He bled profusely,First he bled a lot of red and then started bleeding blue (maybe from his bone or something like i don't understand) and his bone was visible, prompting him to shout why he was shot. The victim started running with one leg, while the assailant chased him. Another bystander looked at me, hoping I would do something or speak, but I was too scared and ran away to save my life, fearing that someone might shoot me too.\n\n\nWhat could this mean?"

Little back story here, I known E1 like 1 year and we become very close, first we met I might have a crush on her but not now. My current crush is G, and she and E1 know each other but not that close. E2 is my first crush on the college but she doesn't know E1 and G. Anyway here is the story\n\nMy bf E1, G and E2 was hanging out in my apartment. Later on my bff tricked us to get naked and basically she was my wingman, then one thing let another G and I started to make out, we kissed touch each other etc. Then I started to make out with E2. While making out I looked back to my bff and crush. My crush seemed very upset and my bff was looking at me furiously. Then I woke up.\n\nSo what do you think this dream means?"

This time, I did keep my eyes open for some reason and there was this spider like creature crawling all over me and my bed and pulling at my covers and making demonic noises. It was dark and furry (not like a hairy spider but like with actual fur) with 6-8 legs. It was maybe 2x2ft in length. That‚Äôs the best description I can give as it appeared kind of blurry. Could this have any meaning behind it? Or is my brain just weird?"

    "body": "I was in a high-class office tower programming something when it suddenly began to collapse. We escaped through escape tunnels into an underground facility. It was huge and equipped with everything you could need. It felt like a country school, flea market and squid game combined. We had people there from all walks of life too: religious figures, retail salesmen and so on. It didn't take long for gangs to form and life in this complex became very stressful. Locks suddenly blocking off previously accessible areas, muggings and riots. I realised I couldn't stay there and had to find a way out. I and a cardinal representing the religion of that world then set out and explored the site further, investigating unused rooms and the like. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat you need to know about this world: apparently there is a two-tier system, and religious people are at the top. Other people are more likely to be neglected when it comes to things like saving them. We finally found a passage behind a drainage grate in one room. As fate would have it, this led to an enclave on a peninsula. Much like the Vatican, this was probably a religious centre of this world. The cardinal took the lead. He was not convinced of this two-tier system, and I was sure he would try to help us. I myself did not follow him, but of course I could continue to observe him in my dream. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nHe entered the compound and was immediately recognised as worthy. He was granted entry. He entered a church where he found a praying priest. The room was covered with strange moving characters and the priest seemed to be struggling against an invisible enemy. The cardinal observed this struggle and decided to intervene when he could make out the priest as the loser of the conflict. He snapped his fingers and the room was immediately flooded with silence. A small demon-like creature fell from the ceiling and immediately withered on the floor. For a moment the danger seemed averted, but as the cardinal approached, a demonic skull suddenly engulfed the priest at the other end of the room and disappeared back into the floor with him. Unable to do anything else, the cardinal retreated. These occurrences did not seem extremely unusual, but rather like a real danger known to the people of this world. He left the room and humbly joined the supplicants who wanted to talk to the head of the enclave. The latter was also very pleased to see him. Then I woke up"

We've been exchanging DMs for the past years but it is totally wholesome and him just being friendly and accomodating. He would reply to my story reactions, or holiday greetings or sometimes very short exchange of messages about his ad or something. My friend thinks it is just his Social Media Manager but I don't think so. Does he really reply to all of his followers? Sometimes I would have dreams of him running after me, like wanting me and desiring me. I know dreams are the opposite but every time I would have dreams about him it is like a continuation of my previous dream. Sometimes I want to think that we were connected in our past lives. üòÇ This guy is a DILF, had a bad reputation with women and just got hitched last year. In my dreams we would be in his house or in a villa somewhere with his family. In my dreams I am friends with his current wife, and he would constantly have some innuendos and I would refuse it as if lowkey scolding him that he should not be acting like that because some people might see us or whatever. There's just that intense feeling that he desires me and I am refusing it tho I badly want him. Trying to do the right thing and all. This has been recurring, but last night in my dream I finally gave in to his wants and something happened to us, tho in a movie it is like a scene that was skipped. ü§£ But with the dialogue and all it insinuates that we \"did it\" and he wants more of it. I tried muting him on IG already, so I won't see him in my feeds. But sometimes dream like this would just show up once a month or every other month. This is just so weird that I would wake up and remember the dream. Am I the only one having this kind of dreams?"

Give it a second\" but without saying anything it hit me. In that half second, they twirled their fingers and there was this black ring with two elongated black horns (like a ram, but straightened) on their finger and I was just like \"oh... you're death. Why are you here?\" And I started seeing a bunch of materials that belong to a friend. I didn't get it at first. I started cleaning everything up and Death just kept looking at me.

Anyway, he was clearly angry at her.\n\nRachel then starts bawling in tears and sits on the couch. My mom barges in (she wasn‚Äôt even in the dream before this) and yells at Eric to get out of her house. I think one of the things that haunts me the most about this dream is that he isn‚Äôt even ashamed of what he said. I think his face may have had some regret, but he was still angry at her and now us for kicking him out. I remember feeling shocked most of all during the dream and maybe angry. I was mainly just in shock of what was happening, it was very quick.\n\nI see Eric every day at school and lunch, so I hope this won‚Äôt change how I view him. I know that the dream isn‚Äôt real, but the Eric in the dream wasn‚Äôt too far off from the the one in real life which scares me. I‚Äôve never seen him act angrily though and I can‚Äôt actually see him threatening rape against his girlfriend. \n\nThe real Eric has very little boundaries with his friends and IMO has a strange (but kinda wholesome) relationship with his girlfriend.  However, he jokingly says he‚Äôs going to rape ppl in my all male friend group, including me (no malice, just being dumb). He even touches us guys a lot to make us uncomfortable, including me.\n\nAll in all, he‚Äôs not a bad guy, but sometimes he takes things too far. Also, sometimes he messes with his girlfriend and ignores her when she says to stop (like tapping her head or tickling her). \n\nAny thoughts on this? This is only the second dream that‚Äôs made me this uncomfortable. And sorry for the essay lol"

I painfully walk to what is supposed to be a restroom, and inside is a large wooden table with oversized wooden chairs all around. The floor of the room is a filthy grey carpet. I sit down at the table on the only open chair and an old man I do not recognize sits across from me. He is eating a piece of bread. He drops the bread on the disgusting floor, and we both reach down beneath the table to pick it up. I grab the bread first and take it away from him.\n\nHe pleads and says he is hungry and needs the bread.

The part that I remember the most clearly is this: we arrived at an official building that looked a little like an opera house or something. It had a buffet, waiters and important looking people wandering about. There, my partner in crime managed to steal Nazi officer uniforms. We disguised ourselves and tried to blend in with the crowd and slip away from the area carefully. I arrived (alone) at a spiral staircase, where someone started chasing me and I realized that I had been exposed. I managed to maneuver between different passages of the stairwell and finally slipped away. I got outside, and easily climbed on the roof of the building. There I rallied with my \"ex\" and we kept running in a panic.\n\nI woke up feeling scared and lonely."

    "body": "I had a dream about a spiritual leader named Moody Wolf. He might have been a healer and he wore a mask which seemed more ceremonial and possibly self-protective. I don't remember it being an animal mask, I don't remember it being any sort of particular kind of mask except ceremonial, even though I have a vague recollection of seeing him in the mask.\n\nIn this dream, perspective shifted a lot so I was at least three different people and I don't believe I was ever my physical, earthly, waking self.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMoody Wolf and I are friends, he often hosts events at his home with many people gathering in his backyard. I think he comes from a Catholic country in South America, in one aspect of the dream, I am an adolescent boy in this South American country and Moody Wolf is a few years older than I am and I look up to him as a mentor. There is a church official in our town who is very cruel to this adolescent dream-self and I remember feeling both sadness and hope when Moody Wolf leaves our village for the United States.\n\nIn another aspect of the dream, that I remember best, I am more like a version of myself, I am in my 60s, which will be true in a few years. I believe it is a Saturday night and I decide to walk to my good friend's home. There is a much older man, a neighbor, walking in front of me. He is walking at a slow gate and I am feeling energized so I walk quickly, almost dancing past him. It is raining and just turning dark. As I turn down Moody Wolf's street, I start dancing in the rain and even think of the movie song but there are no street lamps to dance off of. Then I realize that I left my glasses at home but if I touch my thumb to my index finger and create a small hole to look through, I can see better than with my glasses, it is almost like it is daylight and I easily see the blue and red trim of Moody Wolf's house.\n\nAs I walk into his backyard, many people are already here including five deceased women from my family, my grandmother, my aunt, and my mother are among them. I see my Aunt D. who was my godmother and I want to talk to her but I have pressing business with Moody Wolf and I am wearing a mask so my relatives don't recognize me, they are pretty caught up in their conversation anyway.\n\nI talk to one of Moody Wolf's assistants and he goes to see if Moody Wolf can see me. There is some dream knowledge that something is troubling him and he has taken refuge in his bedroom. At this point in his career, Moody Wolf wears a mask so nobody knows what he looks like except for people from his home village and my perspective shifts and I am Moody Wolf, I don't have my mask on and my assistant opens the door to my bedroom and I hide my face in the shadow as he conveys to me my other self's request to meet him and Moody Wolf agrees to see me.\n\nI suddenly shift back to my waiting self and I wonder how famous Moody Wolf is and I start to search on my phone just as the assistant calls me, as I start walking toward him, I shift back and I am the youth from Moody Wolf's village and I am very excited to see my old mentor but then I pass the bishop that used to treat me so poorly back in Moody Wolf's old village and as I pass the bishop, I become him and become alarmed to recognize the youth I was so hard on back in the village. I think I have just made a deal with Moody Wolf for the glory of the Catholic Church but seeing this youth I used to abuse fills me with dread, I retreat into a shed and watch him enter the house confidently. I don't think he recognized me. And this is where the dream ends, so far as I can recall.\n\nWhile I am not a practicing Catholic anymore, I am very religious, setting time aside every day to talk to God. I am currently suffering from an outbreak of eczema and when I would get a rash as a very young child, my grandmother would call it \"the wolf.\" And I think she probably treated it with boric acid. I have also been playing with the idea that the eczema outbreak is a mask itself, masking some repressed anger or frustration.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nReading over the dream, I realized that when I saw my female relatives, I must have been a version of myself.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI am a 58 year-old man, recently retired, early due to circumstances beyond my control. I am somewhat of an introvert but I do enjoy backyard gatherings. In my retirement, I study piano and ukulele and hope to begin a second career that is somehow related to music."

In the 1st dream I was running around this bizarre hybrid of a home Depot and a Walmart, in what I think was a virgin killer sweater and minimalist underwear &amp; nothing else. I was franticly running around with a power drill.... a nice one like one of those DeWalts, trying to secure all the shelving to the floor and fixing all these weird problems that for some reason needed a screwdriver. I didn't really question how I was dressed or why things need fixing but I was aware, almost nobody in the dream cared what I was wearing because everybody else was scared out of their minds, some were distracted enough to temporarily forget their fear a while however no one would dare leave the store because the mother of all storms was approaching. Like step outside and guaranteed death by lightning bad, random tornado force winds, hail that could leave craters in concrete, strange smelling air that would oxidize metal rapidly and rain that caused instant flooding. I saved a few people like a NSFW super hero from falling objects and shelf's that I couldn't get to in Time. That all I remember of that dream.\n\n    The other dream I had last night took place in at first normal dustly cobwebby rough-sawn attic, at first it was very long almost like a corridor in a video game. As I was moving through it I realized the space Warping effects as I left one part of the attic I went into another attic slightly different version. As I was moving through the attic I was fighting and sometimes killing these giant spiders that would emerge from dark corners (similar in size to the spiders in Harry Potter 2) with a menacing looking knife/short sword. I didn't feel all that powerful in this dream though, In fact I felt pretty Normal strength &amp; really annoyed I had to deal with these damn spiders. So I continued on the spider killing spree all the while the attic was doing its space warping, think a webby rough sawn version of MC Escher's stair art. Then I woke up.\n\nFor context I don't have a phobia of spiders but I don't want anything to do with them, and tornadoes &amp; bad weather don't bother me nearly as much In real life as they do in dreams. Can somebody interpret the 2 dreams? I failed to interpret the first dream and tried to interpret the second And out of curiosity just want more input."

And one night my mom heard a shriek that sounded like a woman being murdered. That same night my neighbor took a picture of one in her front yard just chilling out there. \n\nAnother time my mom was working in the garden with her earbuds in all day and by the evening time when she finished gardening my neighbor came up and said there was a panther in our trash at the front of our yard.

Receptionist (who happend to be irl secretary of our department) scolded me and after some bickering have given me the key to room 708, after trying to locate a room, I ended up going to a glass door at the end of a coridor, outside there was balcony which was like masive and had strange spiral stercases (in front of me and left/right) and there was a little snow, as well as dark night clouds I was wondering were it lead and I had a feeling it was a library.

I took an elavator from seventh to third floor got down to third floor looking for help, then down the staircase to second floor, where I found master key for 4th floor, which I somehow knew would lead me to where I needed to be, I turned right into smaller corridor and took difrent smaller side elavator back to fourth floor. I continued looking for my room number it was past midnight, dark, no lights were on except dim orange light on staircases. I looked for a long time before ending up seeing director and vice director (who taught me first year) of my department making rounds I was next to room 403, then 404, 405 walking slowly behind them I noticed quickly that room 406 was slightly opened and I immedietly knew it was my room as I forgot to close the dorm, the vice director turne dto me asking why I was up at such a late hour (it was aroun 1:30am) I appologise and said I got lost and was looking for my room for hours, after that I got into my room quietly, closed doors and throwed keys on my desk/table, I went to small single bathroom with basic shower and put some watter on mu face, after drying my hands on a towel, I jumped onto my bed, it was close to 2am and I fallen asleep and I had another dream but it was messy and I remmebered only bits and pieces, so I can't tell what that dream after falling asleep in a dream was.

I would say this happens once every couple months, but curious as to why."

    "body": "Hi, I‚Äôm new to this subreddit but I came here to try and find answers about my recurring dreams. I dreamed about the psych ward at least 3-4 times already and honestly, it gets more and more disturbing about my stays in the psych ward. You may ask how u remember your dreams well I‚Äôll answer that it‚Äôs because they are too realistic and vivid for me to even forget about. A little background info on me‚Ä¶I‚Äôm 20 I have bipolar disorder and for me to sleep well on some nights I take a medication called ‚ÄúTrazodone‚Äù. Trazodone is an antidepressant but is mainly used as a sleep aid. Every time I take it I get very vivid and almost realistic dreams and nightmares. Back to the psych ward dreams, i wonder why i keep having them. I had a dream two days ago that I was suicidal and I ended up in the psych ward. Every dream is me ending up in the psych ward or somewhere hospital related. That suicidal one disturbed me but i already forgot half of the dream. What could this mean like is it a sign?"

I talked to my favorite teacher, then afterwards a storm came to the area and i got on a car and sped away. When I got out of the car I was in New York (my hometown). Thats very interesting since my boarding school was in Germany. What could the meaning be? Is it related to my previous dream posted?"

    "body": "Not sure if I should have tagged dream or nightmare, but this dream was distressing at points. I was with a group of what I think was friends and family. There was a celebration type of vibe (as if someone was getting married or moved back home or something like that). We were all going somewhere and someone suggested I drive since we needed multiple people to drive and I had a big car (irl I had a sedan but in this dream I had a minivan or crv or something). While driving, I remember being alone despite that. I could tell that I was driving in my city by the skyline an ocean. Whoever we were celebrating (a woman) asked everyone to check something out on an exit on the expressway. I tried to get off and stop on the ramp exit she mentioned but missed it, and had to turn around. Turning around isn‚Äôt something I could do in irl, but it worked here. While getting off on the wrong exit, I must‚Äôve gotten out of my car well on the ramp, because I fell from the ramp and died. That part was a bit hazy but I was clear that I died. \n\nThe weirdest thing about this dream was that I was reborn. Not into the beginning of a new life, but in a different version of my own life. It wasn‚Äôt that dramatically different. Same city, a lot of the same people, but they were things that were definitely marginally worse. I was less happy in this version. But I wasn‚Äôt very preoccupied with that, more important to me was the fact that no one listened to me when I tried to explain that I had died. I would be hysterical. I‚Äôd be trying to explain this whole story to people who I‚Äôm sure would listen to real life. It wasn‚Äôt even like people were dismissing me as crazy every time, sometimes people would literally just walk away as if their brains had rebooted and didn‚Äôt even know I was talking to them.\n\nAny ideas what this could mean?"

    "body": "In the first part of my dream I was a hunter staying in a wild mountain property walking around with my friends and 2 dogs one was brown and one was white both stayed close by. We walked and frolic in the grass and flowers for a while then head back inside to eat. As I closed the door it got cold and it seemed to be in the middle of winter. I got some soup and bread and ate then went out back and there was snow everywhere. The brown dog rubbed against my leg and whimpered and I noticed the black dog was gone. It was too cold outside to loom though so I came back inside and slept. What felt like a few days after I went out back and the black dog was coming out of the woods with his head down and when it saw me came running back. It seemed like it was okay even though it was outside in a snow storm and I thought that was odd so my friends and I went to investigate. We found a maze made of Grey stone and walked around in it. After a while I came across a cave and decided to go look for myself. In the cave was a few boxes and bookshelves but in the middle was a hunched over figure in a white cloak. They turned around and it was a litch with horns and a golden staff with a symbol of a sun on on the end. He looked at me and then I woke up. I didn't feel fear but it was really strange as I've never had a dream like that."

At first it seemed like random scribbling but I noticed it was only on the edge of the wall where I colored. The color was yellow. I then proceeded to scribble red lines across the wall and draw blue and purple dots in between them. Afterwards I realized that I was drawing and that I had no idea what happened or what I just did. I took it as some sort of mental breakdown, finished my shower and went out of the bathroom. I found myself in my mother's house and she told me that I'll be going to school again and I yelled at her about how the school is stupid and that I can't go back because I already started taking my GED, which in reality was true. I think because of that realization, I woke up. But yeah, I have I feeling at least some of this means something. It's very rare that I remember curtain colors in my dream. Can someone interpret that to me? I tried searching online but there were so many interpretations and I couldn't really find what I had."

The wall of one of them, lets call this on a cabin as that what it was most like, was missing or fell apart at some point. So I go in. \n\nIts got a lot of old handmade furniture. Stuff like you'd see in Little House on the Prairie. Except for the head of commander data, which was sitting on the table. Im a Star Trek fan, so i guess that's where that came from. I did do a double take when i saw it tho. Lol\n\nAs i walk around the table. Which, other then data head, had old dishs. I think the bowls were mad of wood. I noticed another wall was missing. As i looked over to the other building, the shed, i saw the door laying on the ground. Prairie grass was quite tall around it. When I looked in to the shed, still in the cabin, two gold eyes looked back. As my eyes adjusted, I saw its body. A large male lion with black fur stayed back at me. It lay there for a moment just looking at me. Im not sure if it moved first or if i did. But it leaped up and charged.\n\nI turned and ran. I think i threw something at it because it seemed to dodge something. It chased through the cabin and out the way i came in. I climbed up the side of the cabin, which given how old it was, i was surprised it didn't fall apart. The lion didn't clime after me, just staying on the ground. I stayed on the roof till the dream ended. Which was not very long to wait.\n\nAny opinions on what it all may main?\n\nEdit: I should mention that at no time did i feel fear. I ran but was not scared."

SORRY!\" and somehow not being shot at by the armed guards from earlier. Then I got into a police chase in somewhere I presume to be NY which ended up on-foot and what happened next is a blur but I do know I ended up in a building very high up and there was this big important-looking guy who looked like a mix of Dick Gumshoe and Comissioner Gordon telling me I need to un flood London."

The parts I do remember was I was on a beach date with a fun loving girl full of life and we were walking around the marina and laughing and we were both really intimate friends and I felt like I wanted to kiss her and then we did. I felt really close and attracted to her as a person more so than just pure lust but I deffo felt intimacy between us. I was awoken abruptly and lost the dream.\n\nI don‚Äôt know for certain but I felt like this was a continuation of a dream I had in the past but forgot about, where me and this same girl were friends but I felt some attraction and lesbian curiosity about her.\n\nI‚Äôm a little perplexed by the dream as I have always been heterosexual and have found men attractive. Although that said, I am going through a period of my life where I have a somewhat awakened mistrust and misandry towards men due to prolonged and intense negative experiences and recent divorce. Though I did not think such a thing would change my sexuality. \n\nMy perceptions around relationships are generally transforming at the moment so I presume it indicates some sort of longing to have more meaningful intimate relationships that bring me joy and peace, and unfortunately the relationships I have shared with most men have been superficial sex based, imbalanced and when there was more harmony, it lacked the depth and intimacy I crave. Nevertheless I don‚Äôt know why this would be represented by a woman? I don‚Äôt necessarily have better relationships with women than men but I have been honouring my own femininity, so part of me feelings this girl might just be a symbol of myself as the full of life fun loving girl I once was, before I let all my power get eaten away by bad relationships. Though I couldn‚Äôt fully make out what the girl looked like, I did notice she had darker hair and a tanner complexion, and her body was slimmer, whereas mine is more plump, and have paler skin. And that I‚Äôm not actually a lesbian??"

Specifically the serial killer in the movie Ethan Hawke starred in ‚ÄúThe Black Phone‚Äù. Anyways there‚Äôs like 12 of us in this guy‚Äôs basement and he is torturing us and I really mean torturing. Like heating metal chains up with extremely high temperatures, coating them in some sort of corrosive acid and then tying us up in them.\n\nIt was bad. Point is, at a certain point of the dream the killer gave us all an option. I can‚Äôt remember what he said exactly but it was something along the lines of he would let us escape and if we could successfully get away he would let us go but if we got caught he would make sure we die for attempting it. \n\nAt this point in the dream, a majority of the victims run up and out of the basement and into the stormy night. Me along with 2 others were about to make the escape as well but at the last second, I stop and i just return to where I was held captive and that‚Äôs really all i remember.\n\nWaking up from this dream, all I could really take away from it is that i‚Äôm a coward who is afraid to take risks. I would rather, die as a captive than *potentially* die while trying to escape.\n\nI guess the answer I want to know is why? If anyone knows or is able to add any sort additional insight, that would be great\n\nI know that‚Äôs a hard question so I hope someone here has had some sort of similar dream and is able to weigh in with their experience."

It was important that I don‚Äôt end up in the same room as it, because it would harm me.\n\nI dragged a lawn chair outside in the front yard to enjoy the beautiful moon, and some refreshments, thinking that this entity was going to be *inside* my house. It was unseasonably foggy and the moon was like a silver coin.\n\nI went back inside to grab something, closing the front door behind me. When I went back out, I though I‚Äôd check the peep-hole just in case. I saw a shadowy back entity standing still right in front of the door facing me.\n\nSo I abandoned the moon and stayed in the kitchen. But I saw it at the kitchen window tapping on the glass, trying to get in, telling me it‚Äôd be alright if I let it in. It was an old man, but it was wearing some kind of long dress. I knew I wasn‚Äôt supposed to look directly at it so I quickly went upstairs and shut myself in my bedroom with my refreshments. But when I looked again, it was standing menacingly at the foot of the bed somehow. I guess it attacked me? and then I woke up.\n\nI frequently dream of a hostile entity playing ‚Äútag‚Äù with me inside my house at night.\n\nAs normal with my nightmares, I have woken up but the nightmare has not stopped. I feel a sinking feeling of dread and fear, and like there is something or someone trying to hurt me lurking around every corner. Maybe the pain it caused me was my reality. It would have been less scary to stay in the nightmare than to live my day-to-day life."

    "body": "I won‚Äôt say this was a nightmare but I haven‚Äôt been creeped out by a dream in a very long time. So in this dream I was like exploring this extraordinary location that seemed like it had some type of ancient architect structures. Like some big cubes with moss and symbols on them. It was kinda like just a barren random area with this stuff. Almost like an indirect museum but outdoors. There was this pair of huge disembodied feet that I figured belonged to a female for some reason, well they were definitely feminine. I didn‚Äôt even mind them at all since they were just sitting there. But then all of a sudden while I was observing where the feet where they caught my attention by starting to randomly go on a spasm and then they flew in the air and came back down and came at my neck. They were kinda like in a cross position around my neck and gave it a gentle rub which freaked me out so much I ran and somehow came through a door even though I was outdoors, and I ended up in some house and I found another door and went in there and locked myself in it. It happened to be a bathroom. I woke up after this frightened, even though I thought to myself it shouldn‚Äôt have been that scary. I had the idea that maybe the feet belonged to an evil giantess who some warrior defeated and cut her feet off or something."

    "body": "i need help interpreting a fragment from a dream i had last night. i was standing in a room right on the door threshold facing out to a patio of some sort, holding a lighter that was burning vigorously. i don't know how exactly but my left arm caught on fire. it hurt but it wasn't that bad, maybe because i was wearing a long sleeve and i'm assuming it shielded my skin from the fire somewhat. anyway i tried to put the fire out but obviously i couldn't do that holding an uncontrollably burning lighter. i also didn't want more things to catch fire. so i looked over to my left to find a glass with some liquid in it on a table and i dropped the lighter in there. when i had put out the fire on my arm i pulled my sleeve up and at first my skin looked as if it had been left unattended in a frying pan, it was burnt. then all of a sudden what was first sooty and black was just pink and my skin was pretty much intact.\n\nalso i wouldn't describe this as a nightmare cause while it was uncomfortable i wasn't scared, i was calmly doing what i could to take control of the situation."

    "body": "Help with Dream Interpretation, Please\n\nHello everyone! For context, ever since I got pregnant 3 years ago I have very vivid dreams. Usually I don't read much into them because they seem more like just random dreams than actual messages, you know? Also, I'm just really not good at dream interpretation, hence me asking for help lol. \n\nWarning: kind of a graphic dream. Violence and death\n\nI'll try to put this one together as best I can, I'm starting to forget details.\n\nFor some added context: I've been struggling with what I believe for a while. I've recently started adding back some Christian beliefs and practices into my life and combining Christianity and witchcraft together. \n\nI was supposed to be confirmed into my Episcopal church today but decided to wait another year to really determine what my beliefs are.\n\nI was at my Episcopalian church in my dream (I incorporate Christianity into my practice) and my mom and I were walking into the area where church takes place when we saw fire and vultures through the window. There was smoke in the church and it smelled like incense. Im not sure what type of incense. The vultures were trying to break into the church through the glass.\n\nThe Bishop (who actually visited today) gave an evil smile and was trying to convince us to stay instead of leave. It was like that scene from the end of Midnight Mass. My mom and I were the only ones who left the building.\n\nAs we were leaving, I noticed more vultures outside and told mom we'd have to hurry to make it to the car. I had to fight off the vultures and lost my mom in the parking lot. \n\nI was crying out for her and couldn't find her so I just got into the car and there she was, in the driver's seat, hunched over dead, killed by the vultures. It wasn't obvious in my dream but for some reason I just knew that the vultures had killed her by stabbing her with their beaks in her back. I was screaming and sobbing and that's when I woke up.\n\nI really need help. This dream is really worrying to me and I have no idea how to interpret it."

    "body": "Could I request an interpretation on this strange dream?\n\nTLDR: Dreamt that I was slitting the throat of a bad man, but the man became my reflection and I had slit my own throat. There was an overall pleasant tone to the dream.\n\nI (female, 18) was in some summertime fantasy version of my home town where there were bad people (villains but not evil) who may have attacked me or my family and who I remember nothing about except that they were sexually attractive adult men. In the first half of my dream we (me, my family and my dream friends/allies) were chasing these bad people. I think physics was pretty much totally discarded, the world was brightly coloured (like a Wes Anderson movie) with flying, teleportation and such. There was definitely significant danger but I was never really scared, more like exhilarated. \n\nEventually, I caught the main guy and pinned him down, his torso between my legs (on the floor of a floating shed?) and he didn‚Äôt struggle free. Suddenly, I had this big decorative knife and was curious as to what to do to him with it; there wasn‚Äôt a single consideration that i wasn‚Äôt going to cut him with it. First, i lightly dragged it slowly down his face, over his left eye because I thought the scar it would leave would be cool (maybe I wasn‚Äôt intending to actually kill him? I definitely didn‚Äôt feel strongly enough about him to really want him to die, it all felt like a fun game.). Next, I dragged it across his throat, not too hard, laughing happily at the thrill as the blood bubbled to the surface, the man was smiling too, quite flirtatiously. As i was admiring my work, his face distorted and I realised that it had always been my reflection in my bathroom mirror and I was bleeding profusely from the throat (but not not as much as an arterial bleed). \n\n[I think it‚Äôs worth noting that I‚Äôve fantasised about surgically removing the skin from my face since i was a young child. I‚Äôve often dreamt about doing it to myself from a third person perspective, and in this dream, i had thought about removing the bad guy‚Äôs skin in the same way as i‚Äôd do it to myself, starting with the eyelids.]\n\nOnce I noticed that I had been cutting myself, I cupped one hand over my throat to slow the bleeding and continued with my day. The situation took a long time to sink in and when it eventually did, I still wasn‚Äôt scared, but i did realise that i should get the wound sewn up. Strangely, the slash was getting bigger and what looked like my intestines seemed to by trying to fall out of it, as if the cut was to my abdomen. If I took my hand away, I knew that my insides would fall out, but I still wasn‚Äôt very bothered.\n\nI made my way to the local hospital with my family and it was quite busy but seemed like a more relaxed environment than a normal hospital. For some reason none of the doctors wanted to do anything to my wound, they just said that it would close up by itself in a few days (they had the dismissive arrogance of most metal health professionals). I thought that made sense, and had actually already considered that i should just leave it because it‚Äôd be fine soon. However my dad disagreed and shouted at the doctor to sew or glue it up, they reluctantly relented, and did it. I was left with an ugly, (maybe infected?) crudely sewn-up throat but again, wasn‚Äôt bothered. \n\nThroughout the dream i felt (in the first half) happy and excited, and (in the second half) relaxed, unbothered and pleasantly content. \nOverall it was quite a pleasant dream, enjoyable even, because I got to explore experiences that are so curious and alien to my real life. The only thing that I found particularly strange was that for the first hour since I woke up, I could almost feel the chocking, numb pressure of my throat still slit. It was decidedly physically uncomfortable but something about it was mentally very comfortable, and a part of me wanted to go look in the bathroom mirror and drag a kitchen knife across my throat to match the feeling. \n\nThanks!"

    "body": "So growing up for years now I‚Äôve had the same dream about once a year, almost every year since I was young.\n\nThe dream starts with a group of kids (me included) playing out the front of an old looking church with a big bell tower out the front. At some stage in this dream the bell will ring three times, and we all scatter in separate directions like we all know we have to hide, I run straight for the same large tree in the middle of the area every single time, each time looking down at my feet and noticing a different pair of shoes each time. I climb this tree and sit on the same branch each time and by the time I make it up the tree, there are 2 horses pulling an empty carriage that does a lap of the block, then leaves. A short time goes by before the bells ring again, and for a second time, the same empty carriage will do a lap, then leave. The bells ring for a third and final time, but this time there is a lady riding on top of this carriage wearing an old fashioned black dress. The carriage makes it half way around the block this time before stopping. Once stopped she gets off the carriage and begins hunting for the kids that have hidden. I never know what happens to the kids that she finds, but I can hear their terror when they are found. Eventually though she makes it the tree I‚Äôm hiding in, she slowly approaches the tree though she never looks up at me until she gets right underneath me. She finally looks up at me but at that moment, every single time, I wake up. I never thought about getting 2nd opinions on this but recent occurrences and memories have triggered me to become more interested, happy to hear what people think about thisüòÅ"

So my one uncle owns a hair salon in real life his older brother also owns one too but a different one and my aunt works at a restaurant not a hair salon in real life but in this dream things got weird. So the dream starts off with me in a huge crowded stadium winning 1 million dollars in a Pok√©mon tournament. Then it cuts to me and my brother trying to figure out who tried to steal my prize money so we go to the salon to get haircuts and my aunt is the one cutting my hair so on the left side of the table where the mirror and hair cutting tools are is a small silver colored box tv and it‚Äôs showing me winning the tournament on the news and then my aunt says almost under her breath ‚ÄúI should‚Äôve won a million‚Äù so me and my brother hear this and look at each other like we‚Äôre super suspicious of her then the next thing I know my aunt hits me with knockout gas and I wake up on the floor and she‚Äôs not there but my uncle who owns the salon is there and my grandmas in a chair and she‚Äôs getting her hair done. Then I get up and walk over and this time my uncle tries to gas me too! So I guess he was in on the scheme too, although I‚Äôm not sure why he‚Äôd need the money since the place is very successful, but anyway so this time it didn‚Äôt work and I just kept my eyes closed for a second until he walked away then I get up again and me and my brother rush to get my grandma to the car but then my other uncle blocks me and throws out an electivire so I tell my brother to get my grandma into the car and to throw me my pokeball so he does but when I try to throw out a Pok√©mon it turned into a big bouncy ball and bounces back to my hand but despite that I say pikachu use thunder bolt and my uncle is knocked up into the air and flies many many yards away into what looks like a field of tall grass then it cuts to team rocket saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôre blasting off again‚Äù then I go to the passenger side door to help my grandma put her seatbelt on but through the back left window of the car you can see electivire again staring at me menacingly and I think that kind of scared me a little because that‚Äôs when I woke up. Not sure what this dream means but I thought it was hilarious and a week ago on Easter I saw my aunt talking to the uncle who tried to battle me and started cracking up and made a joke that they were scheming again to steal my money so that‚Äôs why it reminded me to finally post this on here today lol."

    "body": "So the dream starts out kind of cool like a mystery where your having to find clues almost like an Indiana Jones type feel to it. So basically me and some other people were looking for these ‚Äúfossils‚Äù (some just looked like normal objects or rocks but it was dream logic) that if put together make some sort of magic thing happen but anyway, so in the dream it was supposedly a school project or something like that but I had never seen the teacher or the other people looking for these fossils in my life. Then it almost seems like a tv show where there‚Äôs a scene of a little girl in a room that had antique objects in it finding a round disc like object almost like a cutscene in a videogame then this one lady from a cop show I watched recently comes in and interrogates the little girl and I come in and sit there for a second to watch them and she asks her questions gently like in the show because she‚Äôs a little kid and then the girl says I have something to show you and she says ok what it is honey. Then the little girl tries to lift some dusty books off of something and tries to grab something but ends up knocking the stack of stuff over and the disc falls on the floor and the cop lady says I‚Äôm excitement that that‚Äôs one of the fossils we‚Äôve been looking for and I pick it up and look at it. Then there‚Äôs another ‚Äúcutscene‚Äù that shows them digging up her front lawn and finding another fossil then putting the dirt and grass back and then it zooms in on a tree and then zooms in to the house across the street like it‚Äôs some sort of clue for the next 2 fossils then I‚Äôm magically teleported to the house across the street where I‚Äôm examining things in the lawn trying to maybe find it. Then I‚Äôm looking and realize it‚Äôs a corner house and see a house next door kind of behind it from that angle and that‚Äôs when a car pulls up with a guy his wife dad and 3 boys looking at the lawn trying to find the fossil and they ask me about it too and I say yeah I was looking but couldn‚Äôt find it. So then we all walk to that other house next door because it turns out it‚Äôs their house and we‚Äôre just standing in front talking when I notice across the street the neighbors have what looks like a mini alter that‚Äôs actually the entrance to the basement and it was creepy and almost seemed like a cult symbol or Halloween decoration and I said it creeped me out to the oldest son and they had one too but not nearly as creepy as that one and I pointed that out so the son starts getting a little offended and I explain myself and then he says he understands and then the dad is like alright kids let‚Äôs get digging so we can find that fossil so he hands me and the kids and the grandpa some small shovels and he grabs a huge one and we start digging. Now I‚Äôm staring around the neighborhood and the whole place is full of huge nice houses but is really quiet and eerie. Then they go inside for a little and sit down then the son comes out and very slowly walks down the front steps but this time he‚Äôs covered in dry blood and holding 2 kitchen knives so I freak out and run inside because he was walking so slow and then I see everyone just sitting down in the living room chatting like nothing happened and then he comes in and they continue talking then stop and stare at him in silence almost like they were saying honey what are you doing cut it out and then he very slowly walks over and I use the two shovels to sort of block the knives but he was walking almost like a windup toy just slowly and straight at me so he wasn‚Äôt swinging them but if I didn‚Äôt move out of the way he would‚Äôve just impaled me with them then he keeps walking so I keep backing away then I take a chair and use it like a lion tamer and manage to knock him down where the knives magically disappeared from his hands and I put the chair over his body and then his family broke out of their trance and rush over to him on the floor and are asking him what he was doing and if he‚Äôs ok meanwhile I run around the wall corner to the front door and start being magically pulled a little towards a door that was to a room not outside then I walk to the door normally but my hands were numb but regardless I clicked the little switch thing on the door and then started to float outside and then I was literally flying and I say out loud that I‚Äôm getting out of this crazy neighborhood and the dream ends. Anyone know what the heck this dream means because it sure scared me lol that‚Äôs why I was glad when my dad told me it was time to wake up can‚Äôt risk falling back asleep and possibly going back to this dream lol"

It's not always with the same people, sometimes my boyfriend or friends, family, my ex (let's not go there) and last night it was work collegues.\n\nIt's always the most vivid around the hotel. Sometimes I have snippets of going out and doing things as part of the holiday but the most vivid parts of the dream are being in the hotel reception area and getting the elevator up to the room which is always on a high floor number. There have been times that I've met people in the bar/restaurant of the hotel as well. It's not always the same hotel either.\n\nThere have been times when something dramatic has happened, a fight (not one I'm involved in), getting lost, there being some kind of incident outside or even something as basic as being late to leave and get to the airport on time to go home.\n\nLike I say, there are a lot of varying factors but it is always New York and always revolving around the hotel.\n\nI don't really have any knowledge of interpreting dreams so any insights welcome!"

I thought it was super weird back then and I still do now years later but it‚Äôs also one of my favorite dreams of one‚Äôs I can vividly remember because the glow of these costumes and helmets almost seemed as vivid and nice as a Disney movie so as weird as it was it almost seems magical lol"

At the beginning she met a man wearing a rabbit mask, and later in a house that she knew was their home but not the house they lived in in real life, there were his parents and one or two other people she knew. However, there were two versions of them, one outside in the yard and one inside the house, one group she knew was evil but he didn't know which. She tried to convince one group that the other was evil but they didn't believe her, they just said they didn't believe her but she must be right (they didn't mean it). Then suddenly they were walking in a book shop and there was a book, some teenage novel she recognised and she saw the price tag. And finally when they were coming out, her mum took her aside and said she was doing this to make him believe she believed what she said and wrapped a dog leash around his neck and yanked it and she died. After all this she didn't want to believe that this was reality but after she felt the ground and could read some things she was very scared that this was reality so she woke up. (I'm very sorry if I wrote incorrectly or unintelligibly, English is not my mother tongue)"

    "body": "Thank you anyone so much in advance. I just woke from a horrific dream and am now afraid to close my eyes or even walk around my apartment alone. For the first 10 minutes I was awake I wasn‚Äôt convinced this was reality and not another dream. \n\nUsually in my dreams, familiar places look different than they do in reality. I always know where I am in the dream even with the different looking homes and whatnot. What I can remember of this particular dream revolves around a woman who was our neighbor for a year until January 2023 (Sarah) and my black cat Wednesday. Sarah and I have kept in touch via social media &amp; Wednesday is seemingly healthy and happy. Wednesday did have a rough beginning of life where she almost died but has been cured of FIP and healthy for three years now. \n\nIn the dream, I remember my husband and I were inside our apartment having some drinks with Sarah. I feel like things may have gotten intimate in the dream but I can‚Äôt quite remember. I do remember the three of us embracing, though, before she went outside.\n\nNext thing I remember is not knowing if Sarah was coming back or had left. She seemed too buzzed to drive. It was winter where we live in the dream and had been snowing. It was night. Not sure how late, but dark outside. I jokingly said to my husband ‚ÄúI better go check on her and make sure she didn‚Äôt freeze to death.‚Äù\n\nI walked down the hall and out the back door onto the balcony. A couple neighbors were on their porches too. I looked left to the nook where our garbage cans live‚Ä¶at the front right corner, lying in the snow, was Sarah and her dog. Dead. \n\nI remember even the world outside my apartment looked exact to reality. \n\nI saw a fireman walk into our parking area trying to direct a fire truck. I remember Sarah‚Äôs best friend standing to the right a ways from the fireman. She looked the same as in reality. \n\nAfter this, in the dream, I had been locking every lock on every door. I was terrified after Sarah died here. \n\n\nMy husband came to the back door on a different occasion in the same dream. I opened it, he asked for something, and I said I‚Äôd grab it. I saw Wednesday the cat walking towards the door and told him to watch for her. \n\nHe willingly let her outside and let her go without watching her. I came out and saw my cat literally disappear. \n\nThen I woke up."

    "body": "It always starts where I walk into a room (not sure if this is any different than a normal dream but I only have this dream about 30 minutes after I fall asleep). After I walk into the room, there‚Äôs always a light that is very very dim, as if my house has just enough electricity to keep it running, but I remember that my laptop was barely charging. Then all of the sudden, a person appears and I feel as if I have to kill that person to move on, it‚Äôs like a level and to win, I have to kill that person. Sometimes that person is some of my best friends, or my family members, or sometimes it‚Äôs just completely random people. They looked like the people that I knew but there was something about them that made them look very creepy. Also this dream was lucid, I knew almost the entire time that I was dreaming and the entire time I was trying to wake myself up from it because it was a creepy nightmare. After I killed that person, I would wake up somewhere else, I remember my basement, a parking garage and my kitchen. Every time I remember that I would have to kill them to get them to stop attacking me. One time I just tried praying to God (I don‚Äôt usually pray and I am not religious) in my dream and I immediately moved onto the next ‚Äúlevel‚Äù. After about 5 times of waking up in a new spot, I finally managed to wake myself up. When I woke up, I was sweating and very scared even though it was a dream, I still had to kill my family members and I was scared.  This weird dream is definitely not interpretable, but I thought maybe if I write it down somewhere I could remember it just for fun lol, I hope i don‚Äôt have this dream again because it may not sound like it, but I was terrified, mainly because i didn‚Äôt have a weapon or anything to kill then, I had to use my bare hands. Very creepy and weird. I‚Äôve had this dream multiple times as well. Mainly just writing this so I can remember it for myself but if anyone has any interpretation, I would love to hear it."

I always seem to end up in a similar street and find this same area of houses with a bushy / shrubby area that I walk I walk through and come out in this little concrete creek / storm water area.\n\nIt's very hidden in all of these bushes and feels like a tunnel made from plants. if I look to the right the plant tunnel just kind of fades away into nothing, and when you look to the left there is an opening a few meters away where the water drops off, it is always sunset.\n\nWhen I walk down towards the open end it comes out from the tunnel to a beach, but I am on a little concrete platform where the water goes off the edge, I can see the water and the beach and like a cliff face but nothing else.\n\nThe unique part is that there is always things floating down the little creek. Sometimes it's something I needed in my earlier dream, sometimes it's random things that I just watch go past, sometimes it's things from real life, a lot of the time it is pottery specifically.\n\nSometimes I start my dream with the intent of going there to get something like an errand, sometimes I just end up there. Sometimes it feels very serene and like a blessing, but other times it feels weirdly ominous. Sometimes I just sit there and watch the things float past and off the edge, other times I am desperately trying to catch something from the water before it goes over the edge (sometimes I do, sometimes I don't).\n\nI'm not particularly worried about the dream, I just find it fascinating and I've been thinking about it a lot while awake, and wanting to go back there sometimes (and hope that it is a serene feeling time)\n\nAnyone had any similar dreams or have any interesting ideas, I'd love to hear your interpretations!\n\n(Edit for spelling mistakes)"

    "body": "I had this dream a few years ago, and I still remember it vividly. I was walking down the street and saw my old crush/first love (?) on the other side of the street. I got very nervous/anxious as I usually did, and I even tried escaping without him seeing me. However, I could feel this bigger presence with me, it felt like a god or higher spirit was with me. I then asked her for some reason who my soulmate was, and she replied ‚Äúhe who is in front of you,‚Äù while pointing to the other side of the road. I remember getting a sinking feeling in my gut when I realized she was pointing directly at my crush and even my heart rate went up. I woke up right after that too and I remember still having that same sinking feeling in my gut even while awake. \n\nOver the years I‚Äôve had several dreams with him, but none of them made me feel this way. I don‚Äôt know if it was just my subconscious expressing my deep desires, but I had never felt so much from a dream before in my life. To this day, I can still vividly remember that dream and how it made me feel, and I can‚Äôt help but feel like maybe it was the universe trying to tell me something. Over the years, I‚Äôve been dreaming more and more with him, even more so in the past couple of weeks, which is frustrating considering the fact I haven‚Äôt seen him in 4 years. I know it was probably just wishful thinking that maybe he could be my soulmate, but no other dream has moved me the way this one has. It just feels completely different to any other dream I‚Äôve had. \n\nAny guidance as to what this dream could have meant or any tips on how to stop my feelings?"

I'm currently writing this on 5am in the morning because this is the time the dream just ended, I just needed to tell someone about this as all of my friends are asleep. The dream would often start in my room, or sometimes, somewhere that I've slept before but isn't my room. Everytime this happens, it's scary. In my dream, I would just wake up for no reason in the middle of the night and there I get my idea, \"Not again.\". I do common tasks like opening my drawers and opening cabinets. But sometimes that doesn't help. Usually at one point of my dreams, I'll get dragged along by some relatives I rarely see into a car. We're driving on a dark road with a lot of trees, and these weird entities or creatures would appear and try to destroy our car and hurt us. Then I wake up in my dream bedroom. This is usually the part where I try to force my body to wake up. It doesn't work. I run to my friends' houses in my dream, to see if they can help, but for some reason, they all act like they're extremely clueless. They act like they aren't human. I wake up at my bedroom, again. This time, I go to my parents' room and just stay there. They're fully awake, getting ready for something. At 3 in the morning? Yep. I open my dad's computer and I try to turn it off thinking I would wake up if I do so. The screen got brighter and brighter everytime I tried to. I open the files of his computer to see if I may find something important. I saw some videos with just a black thumbnail. I didn't open them. I saw a document in his files titled \"OPEN\". I opened it. Then I woke up. The tasks I get are simple but still, somehow difficult. The other night, my task was to text someone. Again, this isn't a story I've made up. I've been having trouble sleeping just because of this. I'm scared that I may not wake up. I'm typing all of this while listening to Taylor Swift. Just to make sure I'm in the correct reality. I think I'm going to crazy, or if theres something bothering me, but I can't think of what it could be. Please help me."

We did this adorable thing in kindergarten where we'd sit close to eachother and read this little tractor book like eveyday. Got to the age when dating was a thing and dated and broke up probably 25 times.(throughout elementary school and middle school) We'd always end up becoming friends again and then one of us (usually me) wanted to date against. \n\nThis slowed down in highschool we were mostly freinds still very close to the point where we could go months without really even talking and just connect right away again like it was nothing. But the last time we dated I was a junior and this is when a lot happened that took it to the next level. \n\nWe never went out on official dates or anything but this time I wanted it to be different because I had a car. She made me so nervous this particular time I didn't even do the whole arm over her at the movie thing. We finished had some taco bell and went back to her parents. We went up to her room and laid on her bed and started watching YouTube I still wasn't trying to put my arm around her at this point but I was uncomfortable and moved my arm up above her head and she just pulled my arm around her. I was paralyzed with so much giddyness and was like \"this is so nice\" she looked at me and was like \"what?\" I kinda blushed and just kinda held her closer and said thank you. She blushed too. Its making me feel good right now even just that little moment.\n\n\nUnfortunately, I fell asleep with her in her bed we were both not supposed to do that because her parents went crazy when they discovered I'd spent the night and we broke up.\n\nWe remained good friends, but the dating portion was over. The prom came around she went with someone else but we ended up spending more time together then either of our dates and it just felt magical, but anywayyyy. \n\nWe graduated in 2017 and pretty much lost contact. We reconnected a few times even recently. She ended up getting married and I was pissed about it for a while because it came out of no where. I got over it and was even really happy for them when they had their kid.\n\nFast forward to now and the other night awhile ago I had this dream that was like an amalgamation of all the time we spent together and I'd we wouldn't have broke up. I woke up crying because I didn't want the dream to stop. And now since this dream she's just been at the front of my mind again. My question is why would my brain do this to me. I feel like I've lost all hope. I haven't dated anyone in years or even wanted to but now this damn dream has made me INCREDIBLY depressed why did I have this dream I feel alone and miss her so much.

The first dream I had some control but the second one, I could literally bend reality to my will (Ran really fast like 30 mph, summoned tornadoes, flew for a few seconds before losing control and having to land).  Anyway, I woke up like 4 times back into the first dream and fell back asleep into the second.  In the first dream I murdered my wife and she came back to life and acted like we had a bad fight and wanted to make up.  \n\n\nWhat does this all mean.  Anybody have any ideas?"

I was in a classroom, probably math. I dont recognize the classroom. In real life im in online community college and i gradugated high school 3 years ago but for some reason I'm in what looks to be a high school classroom setting. Everyone in there absolutely hates me for some reason and they are constantly saying mean things to me. \n\nLike these girls just kept pushing my books down and having me pick them up. There were some girls saying i smelled bad. (Btw it was only girls bullying me which kinda makes sense because majority of girls bullied me in school although i did have some boys bullying me too) At one point I got so annoyed that I yelled \"I fucking hate this class!\" Which I probably wouldn't have done in real life being that I'm so shy. I guess the dream showed how much anger I had buried deep inside of me. I just wanna know why I keep having these dreams. I have them like once a week and it's so tiring because I just want to move on from what happened to me in school. Yes I got bullied when I was young but I feel like that specific event has ruined my life and I'm so sick of feeling like everyone hates me."

Someone, I think a masculine presence, urged me to jump and I did. I wasn't frightened.\n\nThe water was clear and blue, though the cave was dark aside from the daylight coming in, and when I jumped in I went all the way to the bottom, which I got the impression was the point, like it was a challenge or a test or some quirk of the pool itself: when you jump, you go to the bottom.\n\nI dream relatively frequently but tend to view dreams that I actually remember, especially for a considerable period of time, to be important. I had this dream a few days ago and remember the cavern and the water especially vividly. \n\nA lot of Dreams I've had in the past have proven to have connections to spiritual or religious experiences, and I've had at least one that was, in my opinion, a direct message from a deity."

The guy has a gf and I have a bf and everyone knows that (at least about my relationship status). It has become a running joke in the office. They don't tease him but they do say these jokes in front of him. It's usually me who becomes the target so I do respond to them. He's never responded to them. He acts like he can't hear them. NGL I thought these jokes irritated him and I was scared he would think I told one of our colleagues that I had a crush on him or something like that. Last week we both wore black tees. It was still early so other colleagues hadn't arrived yet and he told me jokingly \"Oh no! We both wore black. Now they'll tease us all day about matching our outfits\". I was relieved he also took these jokes lightly. \n\nLast night I dreamt that we were in the office sitting at our designated table and another colleague said something about us dating which I can't remember exactly what he said, then said office boyfriend came at my desk and kissed me on the cheek in front of everyone and I blushed.

Even if I only remember the big picture, it still makes me feel so intrigued. \n\n\nIt was myself and my 2 year old son. We were in the house that I grew up in. My mom went to sleep in her room across the house. My son and I were in my bedroom on the bed gazing out the window at the sunset.\n\nThe sun goes down. We are playing, being silly, getting ready to go to sleep. All of a sudden a huge green lights up the sky. UFOs, flying disks looking type to be exact, start zooming past the night sky. Thousands of them. Faster and faster they go, almost like flashes of blue lights in the green night sky but slow enough for me to see them and know what they are.\n\n\nMy son and I are terrified, I remember the feeling of ‚Äúomg what is happening‚Äù \n\n\nOne huge UFO (disk like ufo but also had a huge bottom to it) seems to slow down next to our house in a small field. \n\n\nIt gets a bit blurry here but next thing I remember was my son and I were sitting in the living room of the home. My mom still had not come out of the room. We were not alone though..\n\nAcross from us was an older woman, and a young adult woman. They told me that they were my long lost family and that she was actually my mother not the mom that‚Äôs in the other room. \n\nI remember feeling so awkward and confused. \n\nAt this point my mom shows up with us, and she tells me nonchalantly that she was going to tell me one day about this. \n\n\nI woke up and man I‚Äôve been tripping about this dream all day. \n\n\n*joke*: I told my mom about this dream and she said ‚Äúit was just a silly dream‚Äù I said, ‚Äúhmmm that‚Äôs what you want me to think cause you haven‚Äôt told me about where I came from yet‚Äù üòÇü´†\n\n\n\nSo yeah has anyone else had a similar dream?

There was also a prison around my wardrobe and other items relevant to our staff's belongings, we were sort of substitute guards to the prisoners in the day time. I was concerned when we locked up in the afternoon, because my wardrobe was inaccessible to me but accessible to the prisoners. I asked if they'll mess with my clothes and was told, \"Oh you should be fine, they burn the clothes every now and then but it's just one night.\" \n\nI tried to make my way in and said something like \"inmates don't touch this, move away from the wardrobe\" I cringed at saying \"inmate\" in my dream I knew that wasn't the most humanizing tone for them.\n\nI made my way inside to retrieve something from my wardrobe. Within the prison a sales rep of ours from the outside sampling like iced sencha or something was sketchily set up in an isolated room staring at a wall. I'd been warned about him in the dream - and had a fear he'd poison me or was not a vendor but in fact a serial killer. I was trapped for a moment with him and drank the sencha (then spit it out all over my shirt but kind of in a dribble making it look like it spilled) someone else was with me and they drank it. It was flavorless and muted. I didn't get sick or die and I was able to walk out of the room. I returned to the street without fixing my wardrobe situation.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAs a note \\*the whole occupational set up in the dream was not representative of any real characters from waking life ...

    "body": "Have you ever had a dream that felt like it had lasted weeks, maybe even months? This morning was one of those moments for me. Ever since it happened I have felt real feelings of grief, pain, and loss.\n\nI had a dream that, like most dreams, starts in a location rather unique and new. I was in this sort of Sci-Fi space city, and inside was an apartment where I lived. When suddenly, my girlfriend (who is real, I just won't say her name) out of nowhere comes home with her hands bundled in a blanket, and inside slept the most precious baby boy. My girlfriend proceeded to explain it was ours and that I am a father. Obviously, I was very surprised and even more confused. She never said she was pregnant, nor had I noticed any changes. I also was hurt as I wasn't able to be there for her during birth. Forgetting the confusion, I was incredibly drawn to... what I suppose was now my son. It was the cutest little bugger. And for what proceeded to feel like months I spent with my son.  \n\n\nHe wasn't a chubby fella but he had the most adorable rolls. He was incredibly charismatic and could always make everyone laugh. He would sit up and observe the area and then make eye contact and just laugh. I began to really connect with him, growing this bond that made me realize I was becoming a father. Over this time, we would visit friends who also lived in the same area. None of them had any children but all noticed how close I was with the baby. He had really become a part of my girlfriend and my life.  \n\n\nOne evening later, it was just me at home looking after my son. I was lying in the lounge room and lifting my boy into the air. Both of us giggled and shared a moment together. When suddenly, I lifted my son into the air and he faded away in my hands like a hologram. This baby that I grew to love and cherish so dearly suddenly turned into blue specs of fading code. He wasn't real. I couldn't fathom what had just happened when abruptly a notification popped up on, what seemed to be, my eyes themselves. It was a popup stating that my subscription has expired and I must pay to continue. A simple pay now or cancel prompt. My son... my baby boy... wasn't real. Before I could even attempt to begin processing what had just happened. I woke up.\n\nEven being awake, I still couldn't think. My baby was nothing more than a subscription. It all made sense why my girlfriend was never pregnant, why I never knew.  \n\n\nThis whole day I've felt nothing but loss... I don't want to do anything. It almost feels like a Black Mirror episode or something. Anyways... there's my dream."

I end up telling some people but no one seemed to bothered by it. \n\nSo I go upstairs to my room (which did look the same as it does in real life) and go sit in bed, and I sit up slightly to look around the room, and I see the snake on the floor starring right back at me. \n\n*This last section is not intended to be interpreted as it was situational and I just find it funny* My cat jumped on the bed at this point which woke me up in a panic because I thought it was the snake jumping on the bed haha!"

He either was saying \"I'm helped/saved or thanks.\" But he looked like he was crying happily or something. It was like a fever dream. :( \n\nYes it did kind of feel like a fever dream. He had a white shirt on and I was confused cause in my religon if you take your own life you go to hell. It was also in a big fancy opera house theater. I was also preforming with a band and they were having thier tour not to long ago before he died. It was strange cause it was like a vison I had.\n\nWhat does this mean I don't even stan Astro that much but I like them."

I could vividly remember how I was tasked to watch penguin eggs hatch, to which I did and watched a thousand eggs get hatched. Their eggs looked odd because they had transparent shells and I could see them in their natal stages. We would also butcher the older penguins and eat penguin meat. The eggs were sometimes boiled and fried. It honestly looked cultish. \n\nI wonder what dream meant but I definitely woke up feeling like I have angered so many vegans haha."

I felt like I could never catch this deer. I had set out with the intention to hunt but it was something I was never able to  achieve.\n\nThe second dream was a number of months ago. I was in my parents back garden over looking fields. In the fields where some of the largest cows I have ever seen (the size of elephants), they where black and white milk cows. The cows where running together. One jumped over the hedge into my parents garden. As soon as it did the grown beneath my feet turned to mud and I was slipping towards this cow. The cow was chasing me around apple trees with no fruit. The cow had a rope around its neck that I used to bind it and escape. On my return to my house an old woman confronted and attacked me. I killed her and woke up after. \n\nDoes anyone have any insight into these dreams? I have been curious about both since I‚Äôve had them. Thanks"

He slowly pulled out the dagger which made him bleed enormously,  he then held out his arm and bleeding wrist as an opened invitation. \n\nBut before anyone else could take turns with his share, I ran and reached out to him , grabbed his arm and wrist then immediately started drinking his blood. Everyone was surprised (I don't know why) by my sudden action while they were watching me . The leader also watched me a bit surprised but amused at the same time, he didn't say anything but continued to let me drink it. \n\nIt tasted thick, metallic and bitter but I couldn't stop drinking it , it felt like a few minutes that I was drinking it and no one around stopped me, despite the fact that I almost drank all of it for no one else to have(pretty much almost hogging it all) . Finally after some time I stopped and let myself out of his arm and wrist, I made a bit of a mess on myself with some streams of blood running down from my lips to my chin. \n\nI felt almost halfway high or drunk taking a rest on my knees and looking up and around everyone. Everyone just stared at me and the leader walked up over me as I look up at him. Then that's when I woke up."

    "body": "So, for context, I have a crush on Kendrick Lamar. I won't say it's too concerning because I can fully acknowledge that it's never gonna happen in a million years lol. But this dream may have meant I am getting too attached.\n\nSo, the dream itself is pretty bad, but the highlighted part for me is worse. Me and my parents are driving very late at night. I don't know why. One thing I remember is this green sports car blasting \"redbone\" by Childish Gambino. The sky was majestic looking. Anyway, we go home, and there are 3 adjacent buildings. The car slows down, then we all get this overwhelming sense that the car is about to blow up. There are 2 robberies occurring in the stores, and a bunch of robbers capture as many people as they can for hostages. Me and my parents separate.\n\nI hide in the 3rd building, the dollar store. But ultimately that store gets held hostage. There's 2 robbers, one is mean and shouting, and the other is a overweight hispanic guy. The mean one tells the hispanic guy to hold us hostage and watch us. The hispanic guy is super nice, and ultimately, it doesn't feel like a robbery anymore. More like a substitute teacher watching us. \n\nThen I see Kendrick. He's wearing the same thing he wore to this past Grammys. He is talking to this girl who looks just like Tessa Thompson. I start to get a raging emotion of jealousy. I strike up a convo with this asian girl and tell her how jealous I feel. She seems to be listening and nods her head, but she does not say anything. The tessa look alike walks up and says she has to use the bathroom, and walks with the robber so she could use it.\n\nWhile she's gone, I approach Kendrick. I say \"Hi Chris!\" and he says \"Hi (my name)\" Long pause. I say \"Long time no see.\" Then he says \"yeah.\" I have no idea why I called him Chris, but here's so more context as to why.\n\nIn 4th grade, my first real crush was this boy in my class named Chris. I really liked him, but wasn't sure if he liked me. Anyway, I couldn't confess my feelings because 1. I didn't want my paranoid ass protective Dad to find out, and 2. My best friend who I known since like kindergarten, was \"dating\" Chris, \"It wasn't actual dating, you know puppy love lol.\" So I didn't want to betray my friend. Me and chris were like best friends though. We had more in common than him and my friend, and they used to bicker a lot. I wanted to tell him how I felt so bad, I even pretended I wanted to learn basketball just to be close to him. My friend never noticed.\n\nBack to the dream, Tessa look alike comes back and they finish their convo. I scoot up towards next to kendrick/chris and listen. I butt in a few times and they don't seem to mind, but I know that it was a convo exclusive to them. They were obviously falling in love. I felt this overwhelming sense of rage, jealousy, and insecurity. I wanted her to die. I wanted to stab her, then I woke up.\n\nI then go back to sleep and have a second dream\n\nThis time, a group of people including me are in a cabin. My dad is there, but not my mom. It's Christmas time. I see some familiar faces. A few hours later, I see my best friend from 4th grade. I don't see Kendrick/chris. Me and her haven't seen each oter in awhile and we embrace, laugh, look at each others  phones. She stays for a good while, then a few hours later, she is gone. Most people are gone. Only like 12 people my dad tells me to take a picture of the food on the table. I take a picture of the turkey, some strawberry and whipped cream cake dessert, and more. I look outside the cabin and see black bears roaming around. Then I wake up.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWhat does all of this mean?"

I ended up sending him a  message on teams saying we must go for a coffee. He was happy that I kept my promise. I am not sure if he is also gay so I am keeping it very subtle. He said he would tell me when he is free but he never did and weeks have passed. When we bump into each other we talk for minutes. Lately I have been keeping our conversations short because I feel he does not feel the same about me.\n\nThe 1st dream that I had I was in bed lying besides him, both of us fully clothed. I felt a presence of other people in the room, observers i think. After some time just laying there next to him I get up and leave and I tell someone, one kf the observers that I am leaving because I told the guy he should text me when he is free so we could go for lunch but he didnt.\n\nThe 2nd dream I had a couple of days later. I was  in bed with a colleague that I work in the same space with but don't work on the same projects. I  have never looked at him in any sexual or romantic way. In the dream we were laying in bed  looking at CDs with our tops off. I thought we had our pants on. He tells me that the CDs have videos of him and his girlfriend or some woman he likes. I leave the bed to g grab something but my penis is exposed. He looks at it and I apoligise, telling him that I thought I had my pants on. He tells me not to worry.\n\n\nThis is so weird.

I have been a victim of CSA before, but the assualt only happened once, and when I was 9. I also used to watch some pretty hardcore pornography material when I was 8-10. If you would like more information on my past for more context, you can look at my posts. I have a therapist.\n\nThese dream are very reoccurnt. They have different abusers, plots and ages, but I can give a simple run down of how they *usually* go.\n\nI'm between the ages of 6-8, and my family either encourages, watches or doesn't believe me when I'm getting sexually abused infront of them or by them. There are some dreams where I am ages 9-16, but I am frequently under the age of 9. There have been many dreams were CP was involved, and each of them was my own family producing it of me, or hiding it from me because they were using it for their own gain. Every single one of these dreams, my family knows, but doesn't care in some shape or form. \n\nLast night, I dreamt my mother produced CSEM of me when I was ages 4-6, and when I found the pictures, I confronted her and she told me that I was acting like the victim, and that the pictures were innocent ( there weren't graphic sex, but I was naked or surrounded by men and looking uncomfortable while they looked at me with lust ). \n\nI am unaware if these may be a form of repressed memories, or if they're just nothing.

I wait in the car with our friend while my mentor leaves with a pistol in his jacket pocket. ~5 minutes later, he returns and says we gotta go, so I start driving. No chase scenes, just going. And I assume we get away with it. Later in the dream, I‚Äôm watching YouTube and find a moistcritical video about my mentor robbing a bank. My mentor had gotten caught, which I guess explains why I had no further interaction with him. Later on he gets let go based on the fact he returns the money.

We talk about the robbery briefly, he says he didn‚Äôt mention me, and then we leave to play Pok√©mon Go just like he and I do irl. \n\nVery confused about this dream and what it could mean.

He was someone I really liked way back in high school (over 10 years ago) but never told him my feelings.

It's just established that we are together despite him seeming very uninterested. I've always assumed it was my brains way of telling me you should have told him how you felt. I don't think about this person. We are literally strangers at this point and my feelings have been gone for him for a looong time. Frankly these dreams are super annoying to have. For once I'd like to have a dream of being with someone that at the very least seems interested in me. Well last night I had one. Same guy, but this time he is the one that comes to me and we actually have conversations and kiss! That's fucking spicy for my dreams haha.

I will admit that the fear mongering got to me in the hours immediately following because I am an anxious person, but after I calmed down and came to my senses (and after a few more god comments) I decided that I had been doomed and gloomed and felt pretty stupid honestly.  \n\nThe reason I am asking Reddit is because my experience with ‚Äúsleep paralysis‚Äù is very different than the traditional or most reported symptoms of sleep paralysis, and I was just wondering if anyone has experienced my particular flavor of sleep paralysis. \n\nSo, the traditional sleep paralysis symptoms are the shadow man, an intense feeling of doom, being terrified by what seems to be a visual entity (not necessarily shadow man), trying to scream or talk (have experienced this recently) and not being able to move, feeling like someone is sitting on your chest, etc. In my first post I mentioned I heard disturbing and angry voices coming from my box fan (IT‚ÄôS A DEMON, REPENT BEFORE YOU MAKE IT MORE ANGRY) which was disturbing, but it turned out to be an obstruction causing the blades to warp which caused it to make weird sounds. That took a few nights to figure out but yeah, not a demon. \n\nANYHOW\n\nMy sleep paralysis is more.. peaceful? It started with, and this is the most common thing that happens, one of my legs just like levitates. It doesn‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs being pulled up by anyone or anything, no outside source, just rising up all on it‚Äôs own. This still happens, it happened last night, and it happens several times. Just up and down and up and down. \n\nAnother way this ‚Äúsleep paralysis‚Äù presents (and each of these incidents have happened only once)  is by the sensation of being picked up and carried out of my bed ‚Äúwife over the threshold‚Äù kind of way, and toward my bedroom door. I was completely at peace until we got to the door and then I freaked out and started calling for my husband (with no sound) and then the second time it was me being picked up the same way but set down gently on the floor next to my bed. It happened maybe 3-5 times that one night and I haven‚Äôt experienced anything like that sense. While that was happening I was completely at peace. I would just be set on the floor and then I was back in bed. \n\nNow I *have*been taking two new sleep-aids, but I looked up all the side effects and the only one that listed sleep paralysis is the one I‚Äôve been taking for six years, and I never experienced it with it before. Maybe it‚Äôs a contraindication between the meds? Surely my psychiatrist would know about that ahead of time? \n\nIf you‚Äôve made it this far, thank you, but i‚Äôm just curious if anyone else has experienced the same kind of peaceful and kind of fun sleep paralysis?"

I did this like two three times for a pride of lions and especially lioness', a boar and a tiger.\n\nThen the dream transformed into me being on fixed track (looked like a street from my grandpa's house) and i was practising driving on this track.

I say the dream is weird because I'm a fiercely independent person and I would probably never take shoes off to my man, unless he was paralysed or something that wouldnt allow him to do it himself.

I began room mating with these random two guys lol that‚Äôs all I remember.\nAny insight would be appreciated!!"

From having family parties, being upstairs folding clothes or what have you.. Location is the same-there.. I have yet to even have a dream set in my new place.\n\nJust wondering if anyone has dealt with this before or if it means anything, and how to change it.

    "body": "I just woke from such a strange dream in the dream a bee was trying to get away from a fast and large spider this spider was morphing from a huntsman into a funnel web and was sprinting to attack this bee but the other strange element of this dream was that before the spider got to this bee it was trying to attack a bird that was trapped in a cage the bird ended up being freed from the cage the dream then showed the bee struggling to get away from this same spider in the dream the spider had attacked it a few times it was trying to continue but ended up stinging the spider in an attempt to stop it attacking the bee then started to die in pain like bees usually do after stinging (I think it is) the bee was laying down to go to sleep and die and then I woke up. What does this mean I think it refers to my work situation in the waking life personally but am unsure before the bird situation someone in the dream was saying that this spider had taken down many other birds and bees as well."

    "body": "I usually don‚Äôt listen to dreams but lately I‚Äôve had two consecutive dreams of specific animals with colours on them, I found it odd so I was wondering if anyone has any input on what these animals symbolize including their colours?\n\nThe first dream that really stood out to me the other night was a dream I had of one of those long green iguanas but it was bright red. Someone was trying to look for it and ended up finding it under my bed, it was wriggling and moving it‚Äôs tail pretty aggressively and in the dream I was worried and a bit afraid because I knew a hit from the iguanas tail would be a nasty pain. I remember reading the animal symbolism, stating that it could mean someone close to me is betraying me or is untrustworthy so that got me a bit worried, so that was stuck in my mind through the day.\n\nNow the next day (last night) I had a different dream, it involved a tarantulas and a Turkey both looked gorgeous, both with bright blue on them, almost how a peacock‚Äôs blue is. All I remember is chasing the blue turkey and then trying to kill the tarantulas because my someone in my dream wanted it dead because they felt uncomfortable with it. Ended up killing it. \n\nThese felt very strange considering I never dream about specific animals, especially with colours so vibrant. Would love any input or thoughts!\n\nTLDR: Dreams about an aggressive Red Iguana, another of me chasing a blue turkey and killing a blue tarantula"

I lift their leaves and notice underneath a part near the roots that looks like an over watered cactus and go to pull it out from both plants and as I‚Äôm tugging on them I think that the pattern on them is beautiful like the diamondback snakes I grew up with in the desert. The moment I think that I feel a tightening around my hand and know without looking that they were in fact diamond back snakes beginning to constrict around my left hand. I fling them to the ground but when I look down at the carpet it is only the heads of the snakes. I notice how beautiful they are and how I wish I hadn‚Äôt plucked them from their bodies. \nThen I woke up."

It's a constant struggle where one might slip and get left behind, so I have to run back and get them, one might be crying when we have to be quiet so I have to calm them. It always ends with us hiding in some corner, knowing we're trapped - the dangerous person or situation is approaching us, and we're all gonna die... And in our final moments, I just try to hold all of them close and sing the lullaby my little brother always needed to hear to be able to fall asleep as a kid - usually my mom did it, but when she was away I took her place.

The river was mostly covered by what i think was some sort of metal, and over the top of the metal was a thick layer of white ice. There were big square inlets in the metal/ice layer which exposed the rushing water and people were hopping in these large holes and getting swept into the stream, they would then appear like 20 meters down stream where the river would drop down a tier and you would see the people happily going down the little falls. The river contiuned with these tiers for like 100 meters, and the place seemed like it was some sort of therapy for these people. Wtf was this dream about? I havent been able to stop thinking about it all day. The girl who took me there has moments of feeling cold to me and im not sure if i think thats part of her personality or if i  think its cos shes just got out of a long relationship and is feeling  stunned/is healing from it. Because of this im not actively pursuing her but she asked me to hang out with her next week. Im wondering if the dream is about those thoughts ive had about her since she took me there or if its about my own life and i need to \"jump in the water\" and pursue her. Such a weird dream.

    "body": "I wanted to reach out to the collective and see what you all think. \n\nIn the dream I have a variety of different pets in aquariums in my home. The most common are reptiles and fish. I own them and they are typically in my basement. There are dozens of these aquariums and my basement almost looks like a pet store. These animals are neglected. Often emaciated and their tanks are filthy. The theme is that I‚Äôm almost frantically trying to feed the various reptiles and fish while feeling an immense sense of guilt for letting this get this bad. The thought of needing to maintain all of their enclosures is immensely stressful to me due to the sheer quantity of aquariums and also due to poor condition of them. The dream usually ends with me feeding the animals to keep them alive but never cleaning out their enclosures."

Then I woke up.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't recall any other details. There is nothing in my life I can relate this experience to. Hoping someone can help!"

    "body": "So I have never smoked anything even once in my life, but I had a dream where I was smoking. There where 4 dream days (there was not a proper transition, switching days was seeing black for a second and then recognizing it as different), and I made sure to not smoke everyday for some reason, only the first and last. The overwhelming emotion for parts of the dream seemed to be stress oddly enough, and smoking relaxed me and made me mentally calm and aware (as far as it goes in dreams). As I was waking up I was craving smoking in real life until I was fully awake and realized it was a dream. Once again I've never had even one smoke so this seems very strange to me. My only guess is that my subconscious is telling me I need a coping mechanism for stress, (hopefully not actually smoking), but I don't know. Thoughts are appreciated."

    "body": "I dozed off on the couch and had a dream where I was on a balcony over my yard and saw a large black dog (more like a small wolf) on the outside of my back fence. His whole face was white like how dogs get when they're too old. I knew he was eyeballing my livestock, but by the time I got out the door with the shotgun, he was running on his hind legs with a sheep under his left arm, a fox under his right, and a rooster in his teeth. I tracked him through the woods and followed him up to this raised platform, almost like a wooden lookout tower from an old army fort. The whole time I heard this heavy exhaling coming from different angles. When I climbed to the top, I pointed the fun at him, and he walked towards me, putting the barrel in his mouth, never breaking eye contact. The gun morphed so that it was reversed, with the butt in his mouth and the barrel in my face. He started to growl, and then he barked as I woke up.\n\nCan someone please explain?"

    "body": "So It was mid-day, pretty sunny and it was in some lower-income neighborhood. I was at this textile factory where every thread was all around the factory, even at the back door where you had to go through the threaded \"fence of threads\" that were on the door. I managed to get through it and then I remembered that I've had my THC pen in my pocket, it was white and had some orange colors on it. Then I go sit on this curb in some shade, it was pretty chill, then I see this twitch streamer Cinnabrit, seems like she's in a semi-hurry and I said: \"Are you that twitch streamer?\". She said: \"Yeah, that's me.\" Then I ask for a picture, we snap a pretty good photo but I saw she wanted to take a pic so she could send it to me for some reason? She also told me that she'll talk about this moment on her next stream. We said bye to each other and that's that. I started walking along the street and the next thing I remember, it was night time and right beside that factory was a fast food place, pretty modern ([something like this](https://i.imgur.com/VhKPaER.png[/img]) without the pizza hut logo). They were selling burgers but I didn't want to order any. All of the sudden I see my friends Matthew and Victor sitting there and eating. I go over them and I pull out the THC pen. They take a few puffs along with me and we start laughing very hard. Next thing you know, they pull Victor into the back office for an unknown reason. I get worried but Matthew doesn't, so I leave the burger place to go see what's going on in the back. I see Victor talking to some businessman through a tinted window. Few seconds later I hear someone say: \"They do that every time man... cmon let's go.\". It was Paper Boi from the tv Show Atlanta. He was wearing [this exact outfit](https://i.imgur.com/qOk3Mi2.png). So I follow him to this ghetto looking gas station/deli and it was semi-crowded. Paper Boi ordered some spicy wings, I ordered some regular fried chicken with lots of fries and a piece of cake. While we were waiting, Paper Boi hopped inside of a Mountain Dew cooler and threw two Mountain Dew branded basketballs, one blue, the other one green. He threw the green one to me, the other one he kept for himself, he also stole a couple of Mountain Dews for himself as well. I didn't want to get caught stealing so I threw my green ball outside for a couple of seconds just enough while I pay for my meal. Nobody was at the counter so I went to the back and called someone to charge me for the meal, they took their time to come and I was kinda mad at them but I still paid. We bought the food and left. When I tried to find the green ball there was no ball in sight. I had the feeling someone had stole it. We started going home by foot but it was almost dawn and there was some wind and a little bit of rain but it was still hot outside. We saw some teenagers in basketball jerseys leave the court because it was constantly storming right on the court. We just avoided the storm by going to the closest empty road. That road had trees on both sides and the rain was starting to get more intense, it was pretty relaxing actually. When the trees stopped my phone started ringing and at the same time we stepped on a curved escalator that was going downwards in some huge utopian world in the skies. I answered the phone and it was my Uncle who asked when should he pick me up today, I said that I don't know and that I'll tell him later. I hung up and woke up.\n\nI'm 18, Male, Straight ENTP"

You have to climb up the side of a mountain to get to the place (which is really scary since I'm terrified of hights in my dreams, not in real life) and there is an opening at the side of the mountain to enter. Once you enter it is the most unbelievable amazing beautiful sunny place, there is water to swim in and waterfalls. In my other dreams I never went there, I always just told people about it and suggested that we go there some day but last night I went there in my dream. We climbed up the mountain and got to the place where there were a lot of other people and there was a restaurant, stores and other stuff that wasn't there before and other easier ways to get there, but it was still really cool and I still liked it.

However, I spent 20 years of my life with her, (I‚Äôm 23, she passed at 26) we were inseparable at one point, seeing each other every week, at church, work (worked together) or just to hang out, so it has hit me. \n\nMy dream was so odd, I was driving past a shop or cafe etc. and saw her and her sister through the window. I stop and go in and realise that everyone knew she hadn‚Äôt passed and were hiding it from me. Suddenly I remember the two of them in my house, me in a complete state of shock that she is alive and that everyone lied to me, it was a sick joke. I saw her body, went to her funeral, but it was all a facade. \n\nI told my mother who was gobsmacked, she also felt betrayed like me. Suddenly my friend‚Äôs family are at my house walking slowly out the front door, I stand by the door cursing them, sobbing, asking why they hid this from me, why I grieved for no reason, but no answer. I watch them leave and they are never to be seen again. This is all I remember but the dream was lengthy and very emotional. It was so vivid that I woke up questioning whether she had passed or not."
