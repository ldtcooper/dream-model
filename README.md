# Dream Model

## Introduction

Back in Winter 2020, I decided that I wanted to try working on a little side project. The basic idea was to download a bunch of posts from r/DreamInterpretation and train a text-generation model on them. I was able to do all of that, but the model itself wasn't especially good. You can check it out [here](https://github.com/ldtcooper/dream-generator) if you want. 

Several years later after a lot of advances in NLP and a lot of skill-building on my own part, I decided to give the project another try. 

## Setup

## Structure

- The `/dream-catcher` directory is the data scraper that downloads posts from r/DreamInterpretation.
